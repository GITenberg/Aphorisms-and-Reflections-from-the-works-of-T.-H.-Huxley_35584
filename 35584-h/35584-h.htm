<h2 class="center">PREFACE</h2>

<p>Although a man by his works and personality
shall have made his mark upon the age he lives in,
yet when he has passed away and his influence
with him, the next generation, and still more the
succeeding one, will know little of this work, of his
ideals and of the goal he strove to win, although for
the student his scientific work may always live.</p>

<p>Thomas Henry Huxley may come to be remembered
by the public merely as the man who held
that we were descended from the ape, or as the
apostle of Darwinism, or as the man who worsted
Bishop Wilberforce at Oxford.</p>

<p>To prevent such limitation, and to afford more
intimate and valuable reasons for remembrance of
this man of science and lover of his fellow-men, I
have gathered together passages, on widely differing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
themes, from the nine volumes of his "Essays,"
from his "Scientific Memoirs" and his "Letters,"
to be published in a small volume, complete in itself
and of a size that can be carried in the pocket.</p>

<p>Some of the passages were picked out for their
philosophy, some for their moral guidances, some
for their scientific exposition of natural facts, or
for their insight into social questions; others for
their charms of imagination or genial humour, and
many&mdash;not the least&mdash;for their pure beauty of lucid
English writing.</p>

<p>In so much wealth of material it was difficult to
restrict the gathering.</p>

<p>My great wish is that this small book, by the
easy method of its contents, may attract the attention
of those persons who are yet unacquainted
with my husband's writings; of the men and women
of leisure, who, although they may have heard of
the "Essays," do not care to work their way through
the nine volumes; of others who would like to read
them, but who have either no time to do so or coin
wherewith to buy them. More especially do I hope
that these selections may attract the attention of the
working man, whose cause my husband so ardently
espoused, and to whom he was the first to reveal,
by his free lectures, the loveliness of Nature,
the many rainbow-coloured rays of science, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
show forth to his listeners how all these glorious
rays unite in the one pure white light of holy
truth.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to our son Leonard Huxley
for weeding out the overgrowth of my extracts,
for indexing the text of the book and seeing
it through the press for me.</p>

<h2 class="center">APHORISMS AND REFLECTIONS</h2>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_I" id="Num_I">I</a></p>

<p>There is no alleviation for the sufferings of mankind
except veracity of thought and of action, and
the resolute facing of the world as it is when the
garment of make-believe by which pious hands
have hidden its uglier features is stripped off.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_II" id="Num_II">II</a></p>

<p>Natural knowledge, seeking to satisfy natural
wants, has found the ideas which can alone still
spiritual cravings. I say that natural knowledge, in
desiring to ascertain the laws of comfort, has been
driven to discover those of conduct, and to lay the
foundations of a new morality.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_III" id="Num_III">III</a></p>

<p>The improver of natural knowledge absolutely
refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For
him, scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith
the one unpardonable sin.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_IV" id="Num_IV">IV</a></p>

<p>The man of science has learned to believe in
justification, not by faith, but by verification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_V" id="Num_V">V</a></p>

<p>No delusion is greater than the notion that
method and industry can make up for lack of motherwit,
either in science or in practical life.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_VI" id="Num_VI">VI</a></p>

<p>Nothing great in science has ever been done by
men, whatever their powers, in whom the divine
afflatus of the truth-seeker was wanting.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_VII" id="Num_VII">VII</a></p>

<p>In science, as in art, and, as I believe, in every
other sphere of human activity, there may be wisdom
in a multitude of counsellors, but it is only in one or
two of them.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_VIII" id="Num_VIII">VIII</a></p>

<p>Nothing can be more incorrect than the assumption
one sometimes meets with, that physics has one
method, chemistry another, and biology a third.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_IX" id="Num_IX">IX</a></p>

<p>Anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific
work is aware that those who refuse to go beyond
fact, rarely get as far as fact; and anyone who has
studied the history of science knows that almost
every great step therein has been made by the
"anticipation of Nature."</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_X" id="Num_X">X</a></p>

<p>There are three great products of our time.... One
of these is that doctrine concerning the constitution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
matter which, for want of a better name, I will call
"molecular"; the second is the doctrine of the conservation
of energy; the third is the doctrine of
evolution.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XI" id="Num_XI">XI</a></p>

<p>M. Comte's philosophy, in practice, might be
compendiously described as Catholicism <i>minus</i>
Christianity.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XII" id="Num_XII">XII</a></p>

<p>Fact I know; and Law I know; but what is this
Necessity, save an empty shadow of my own mind's
throwing?</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XIII" id="Num_XIII">XIII</a></p>

<p>We live in a world which is full of misery and
ignorance, and the plain duty of each and all of us
is to try to make the little corner he can influence
somewhat less miserable and somewhat less ignorant
than it was before he entered it.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XIV" id="Num_XIV">XIV</a></p>

<p>The man of science, who, forgetting the limits of
philosophical inquiry, slides from these formul&aelig; and
symbols into what is commonly understood by
materialism, seems to me to place himself on a level
with the mathematician, who should mistake the <i>x</i>'s
and <i>y</i>'s with which he works his problems for real
entities&mdash;and with this further disadvantage, as
compared with the mathematician, that the blunders
of the latter are of no practical consequence, while
the errors of systematic materialism may paralyse
the energies and destroy the beauty of a life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XV" id="Num_XV">XV</a></p>

<p>There are some men who are counted great
because they represent the actuality of their own
age, and mirror it as it is. Such an one was
Voltaire, of whom it was epigrammatically said,
"he expressed everybody's thoughts better than
anybody." But there are other men who attain greatness
because they embody the potentiality of their
own day, and magically reflect the future. They
express the thoughts which will be everybody's two
or three centuries after them. Such an one was
Descartes.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XVI" id="Num_XVI">XVI</a></p>

<p>"Learn what is true, in order to do what is
right," is the summing up of the whole duty of man,
for all who are unable to satisfy their mental hunger
with the east wind of authority.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XVII" id="Num_XVII">XVII</a></p>

<p>When I say that Descartes consecrated doubt, you
must remember that it was that sort of doubt which
Goethe has called "the active scepticism, whose
whole aim is to conquer itself"; and not that other
sort which is born of flippancy and ignorance, and
whose aim is only to perpetuate itself, as an excuse
for idleness and indifference.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XVIII" id="Num_XVIII">XVIII</a></p>

<p>What, then, is certain?... Why, the fact that the
thought, the present consciousness, exists. Our
thoughts may be delusive, but they cannot be
fictitious. As thoughts, they are real and existent,
and the cleverest deceiver cannot make them
otherwise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XIX" id="Num_XIX">XIX</a></p>

<p>Thought is existence. More than that, so far as
we are concerned, existence is thought, all our conceptions
of existence being some kind or other of
thought.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XX" id="Num_XX">XX</a></p>

<p>It is enough for all the practical purposes of human
existence if we find that our trust in the representations
of consciousness is verified by results; and
that, by their help, we are enabled "to walk sure-footedly
in this life."</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXI" id="Num_XXI">XXI</a></p>

<p>It is because the body is a machine that education
is possible. Education is the formation of habits, a
superinducing of an artificial organisation upon the
natural organisation of the body; so that acts,
which at first required a conscious effort, eventually
became unconscious and mechanical.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXII" id="Num_XXII">XXII</a></p>

<p>I protest that if some great Power would agree to
make me always think what is true and do what is
right, on condition of being turned into a sort of
clock and wound up every morning before I got
out of bed, I should instantly close with the offer.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXIII" id="Num_XXIII">XXIII</a></p>

<p>The only freedom I care about is the freedom to
do right; the freedom to do wrong I am ready to
part with on the cheapest terms to anyone who will
take it of me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXIV" id="Num_XXIV">XXIV</a></p>

<p>Whatever evil voices may rage, Science, secure
among the powers that are eternal, will do her work
and be blessed.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXV" id="Num_XXV">XXV</a></p>

<p>There is assuredly no more effectual method of
clearing up one's own mind on any subject than by
talking it over, so to speak, with men of real power
and grasp, who have considered it from a totally
different point of view.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXVI" id="Num_XXVI">XXVI</a></p>

<p>The parallax of time helps us to the true position
of a conception, as the parallax of space helps us to
that of a star.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXVII" id="Num_XXVII">XXVII</a></p>

<p>[If animals are conscious automata with souls]
the soul stands related to the body as the bell of a
clock to the works, and consciousness answers
to the sound which the bell gives out when it is
struck.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXVIII" id="Num_XXVIII">XXVIII</a></p>

<p>Logical consequences are the scarecrows of fools
and the beacons of wise men.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXIX" id="Num_XXIX">XXIX</a></p>

<p>The only question which any wise man can ask
himself, and which any honest man will ask himself,
is whether a doctrine is true or false.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXX" id="Num_XXX">XXX</a></p>

<p>Of all the senseless babble I have ever had
occasion to read, the demonstrations of these philosophers
who undertake to tell us all about the
nature of God would be the worst, if they were not
surpassed by the still greater absurdities of the
philosophers who try to prove that there is no
God.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXI" id="Num_XXXI">XXXI</a></p>

<p>That which is to be lamented, I fancy, is not that
society should do its utmost to help capacity to
ascend from the lower strata to the higher, but that
it has no machinery by which to facilitate the
descent of incapacity from the higher strata to the
lower.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXII" id="Num_XXXII">XXXII</a></p>

<p>Time, whose tooth gnaws away everything else,
is powerless against truth.</p>

<p>Misery is a match that never goes out.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXIV" id="Num_XXXIV">XXXIV</a></p>

<p>Genius as an explosive power beats gunpowder
hollow; and if knowledge, which should give that
power guidance, is wanting, the chances are not
small that the rocket will simply run amuck among
friends and foes.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXV" id="Num_XXXV">XXXV</a></p>

<p>Thoughtfulness for others, generosity, modesty,
and self-respect, are the qualities which make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
real gentleman, or lady, as distinguished from the
veneered article which commonly goes by that
name.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXVI" id="Num_XXXVI">XXXVI</a></p>

<p>The higher the state of civilisation, the more
completely do the actions of one member of the
social body influence all the rest, and the less
possible is it for any one man to do a wrong thing
without interfering, more or less, with the freedom
of all his fellow-citizens.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXVII" id="Num_XXXVII">XXXVII</a></p>

<p>I take it that the good of mankind means the
attainment, by every man, of all the happiness
which he can enjoy without diminishing the happiness
of his fellow men.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XXXVIII" id="Num_XXXVIII">XXXVIII</a></p>

<p>Education promotes peace by teaching men the
realities of life and the obligations which are
involved in the very existence of society; it promotes
intellectual development, not only by training the
individual intellect, but by sifting out from the
masses of ordinary or inferior capacities, those
who are competent to increase the general welfare
by occupying higher positions; and, lastly,
it promotes morality and refinement, by teaching
men to discipline themselves, and by leading them
to see that the highest, as it is the only permanent,
content is to be attained, not by grovelling in the
rank and steaming valleys of sense, but by continual
striving towards those high peaks, where, resting
in eternal calm, reason discerns the undefined but
bright ideal of the highest Good&mdash;"a cloud by day,
a pillar of fire by night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Missionaries, whether of philosophy or of religion,
rarely make rapid way, unless their preachings fall
in with the prepossessions of the multitude of shallow
thinkers, or can be made to serve as a stalking-horse
for the promotion of the practical aims of the
still larger multitude, who do not profess to think
much, but are quite certain they want a great
deal.</p>

<p>The population question is the real riddle of the
sphinx, to which no political &#338;dipus has as yet
found the answer. In view of the ravages of the
terrible monster, over-multiplication, all other riddles
sink into insignificance.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XLVI" id="Num_XLVI">XLVI</a></p>

<p>The "Law of Nature" is not a command to do,
or to refrain from doing, anything. It contains, in
reality, nothing but a statement of that which a
given being tends to do under the circumstances of
its existence; and which, in the case of a living
and sensitive being, it is necessitated to do, if it is
to escape certain kinds of disability, pain, and
ultimate dissolution.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XLVII" id="Num_XLVII">XLVII</a></p>

<p>Probably none of the political delusions which
have sprung from the "natural rights" doctrine has
been more mischievous than the assertion that all
men have a natural right to freedom, and that those
who willingly submit to any restriction of this
freedom, beyond the point determined by the deductions
of <i>a priori</i> philosophers, deserve the title of
slave. But to my mind, this delusion is incomprehensible
except as the result of the error of confounding
natural with moral rights.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_XLVIII" id="Num_XLVIII">XLVIII</a></p>

<p>The very existence of society depends on the
fact that every member of it tacitly admits that
he is not the exclusive possessor of himself, and
that he admits the claim of the polity of which

what we call the laws of Nature. The player on the
other side is hidden from us. We know that his play

the smallest allowance for ignorance. To the man

<p>To every one of us the world was once as fresh and

susceptible of any other mode of instruction, Nature
took us in hand, and every minute of waking life
brought its educational influence, shaping our actions
into rough accordance with Nature's laws, so that
we might not be ended untimely by too gross
disobedience. Nor should I speak of this process of
education as past for any one, be he as old as he may.
For every man the world is as fresh as it was at the
first day, and as full of untold novelties for him who
has the eyes to see them. And Nature is still continuing

in itself, an education broader and more comprehensive
than much that passes under that name.
There is no side of the intellect which it does not call
into play, no region of human knowledge into which
either its roots, or its branches, do not extend; like
the Atlantic between the Old and the New Worlds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
its waves wash the shores of the two worlds of
matter and of mind; its tributary streams flow from
both; through its waters, as yet unfurrowed by the

from the one to the other; far away from that
North-west Passage of mere speculation, in which
so many brave souls have been hopelessly frozen

<p>Examination, like fire, is a good servant, but a bad

watch appear to them to become deteriorated by the
constant effort to pass this or that examination, just
as we hear of men's brains becoming affected by the

pass, not to know; and outraged Science takes
her revenge. They do pass, and they don't know.</p>

<p>So far as the laws of conduct are determined by
the intellect, I apprehend that they belong to science,
and to that part of science which is called morality.
But the engagement of the affections in favour of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
particular kind of conduct which we call good, seems
to me to be something quite beyond mere science. And
I cannot but think that it, together with the awe and
reverence, which have no kinship with base fear, but
arise whenever one tries to pierce below the surface
of things, whether they be material or spiritual, constitutes
all that has any unchangeable reality in
religion.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is
the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to

<p>There is no mode of exercising the faculty of
observation and the faculty of accurate reproduction
of that which is observed, no discipline which so
readily tests error in these matters, as drawing
properly taught. And by that I do not mean artistic
drawing; I mean figuring natural objects. I do not
wish to exaggerate, but I declare to you that, in my
judgment, the child who has been taught to make an
accurate elevation, plan and section of a pint pot has
had an admirable training in accuracy of eye and

<p>It is a great many years since, at the outset of my
career, I had to think seriously what life had to offer
that was worth having. I came to the conclusion
that the chief good, for me, was freedom to learn,
think, and say what I pleased, when I pleased. I
have acted on that conviction, and have availed
myself of the "rara temporum felicitas ubi sentire
qu&aelig; velis, et qu&aelig; sentias dicere licet," which is now
enjoyable, to the best of my ability; and though
strongly, and perhaps wisely, warned that I should
probably come to grief, I am entirely satisfied with
the results of the line of action I have adopted.</p>

calls it inspiration, a third calls it insight; but the
"intending of the mind," to borrow Newton's well-known
phrase, the concentration of all the rays of
intellectual energy on some one point, until it glows

<p>Quite apart from deliberate and conscious fraud

<p>This modern reproduction of the ancient prophet,

evidence, to whom these affirmations inevitably suggest
the previous question: "How do you know that
the Lord saith it?" "How do you know that the
Lord doeth it?" and who is compelled to demand
that rational ground for belief, without which, to
the man of science, assent is merely an immoral
pretence.</p>

<p>And it is this rational ground of belief which
the writers of the Gospels, no less than Paul, and
Eginhard, and Fox, so little dream of offering that
they would regard the demand for it as a kind of

which all the Churches have insisted, that honest
disbelief in their more or less astonishing creeds
is a moral offence, indeed a sin of the deepest dye,
deserving and involving the same future retribution
as murder and robbery. If we could only see, in one
view, the torrents of hypocrisy and cruelty, the lies,
the slaughter, the violations of every obligation of
humanity, which have flowed from this source along
the course of the history of Christian nations, our

<p>Agnostioism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method,
the essence of which lies in the rigorous application
of a single principle. That principle is of great
antiquity; it is as old as Socrates; as old as the
writer who said, "Try all things, hold fast by that
which is good"; it is the foundation of the Reformation,
which simply illustrated the axiom that every
man should be able to give a reason for the faith
that is in him; it is the great principle of Descartes;
it is the fundamental axiom of modern science.
Positively the principle may be expressed: In
matters of the intellect, follow your reason as far as
it will take you, without regard to any other consideration.
And negatively: In matters of the
intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain
which are not demonstrated or demonstrable. That
I take to be the agnostic faith, which if a man keep
whole and undefiled, he shall not be ashamed to look
the universe in the face, whatever the future may
have in store for him.</p>

<p>That one should rejoice in the good man, forgive
the bad man, and pity and help all men to the best of
one's ability, is surely indisputable. It is the glory
of Judaism and of Christianity to have proclaimed
this truth, through all their aberrations. But the
worship of a God who needs forgiveness and help,
and deserves pity every hour of his existence, is no
better than that of any other voluntarily selected
fetish. The Emperor Julian's project was hopeful
in comparison with the prospects of the Comtist
Anthropolatry.</p>

<p>The Cleric asserts that it is morally wrong not to
believe certain propositions, whatever the results of
a strict scientific investigation of the evidence of
these propositions. He tells us "that religious error
is, in itself, of an immoral nature." He declares
that he has prejudged certain conclusions, and looks
upon those who show cause for arrest of judgment
as emissaries of Satan. It necessarily follows that,
for him, the attainment of faith, not the ascertainment
of truth, is the highest aim of mental life.
And, on careful analysis of the nature of this faith,
it will too often be found to be, not the mystic process
of unity with the Divine, understood by the
religious enthusiast; but that which the candid
simplicity of a Sunday scholar once defined it to be.
"Faith," said this unconscious plagiarist of Tertullian,
"is the power of saying you believe things

<p>The development of exact natural knowledge in
all its vast range, from physics to history and
criticism, is the consequence of the working out,
in this province, of the resolution to "take nothing
for truth without clear knowledge that it is such";
to consider all beliefs open to criticism; to regard
the value of authority as neither greater nor less
than as much as it can prove itself to be worth.
The modern spirit is not the spirit "which always
denies," delighting only in destruction; still less is
it that which builds castles in the air rather than
not construct; it is that spirit which works and
will work "without haste and without rest," gathering

the same in an ape, or in a dog, and in a man. And
the suggestion that we must stop at the exact point
at which direct proof fails us, and refuse to believe
that the similarity which extends so far stretches
yet further, is no better than a quibble. Robinson

<p>Descartes, as we have seen, illustrates what he
means by an innate idea, by the analogy of hereditary
diseases or hereditary mental peculiarities, such as
generosity. On the other hand, hereditary mental
tendencies may justly be termed instincts; and still
more appropriately might those special proclivities,
which constitute what we call genius, come into the

the boy Pascal who evolved Euclid out of his own
consciousness: all these may be said to have been
impelled by instinct, as much as are the beaver and
the bee. And the man of genius is distinct in kind
from the man of cleverness, by reason of the working
within him of strong innate tendencies&mdash;which
cultivation may improve, but which it can no
more create than horticulture can make thistles
bear figs. The analogy between a musical instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and the mind holds good here also. Art and
industry may get much music, of a sort, out of a

chance against an organ. The innate musical

<p>It is notorious that, to the unthinking mass of
mankind, nine-tenths of the facts of life do not
suggest the relation of cause and effect; and they
practically deny the existence of any such relation
by attributing them to chance. Few gamblers but
would stare if they were told that the falling of a
die on a particular face is as much the effect of a
definite cause as the fact of its falling; it is a proverb
that "the wind bloweth where it listeth"; and even
thoughtful men usually receive with surprise the
suggestion, that the form of the crest of every wave
that breaks, wind-driven, on the sea-shore, and the
direction of every particle of foam that flies before
the gale, are the exact effects of definite causes;
and, as such, must be capable of being determined,
deductively, from the laws of motion and the properties
of air and water. So again, there are large
numbers of highly intelligent persons who rather
pride themselves on their fixed belief that our
volitions have no cause; or that the will causes
itself, which is either the same thing, or a contradiction
in terms.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Hume does not refer to the
sentimental arguments for the immortality of the
soul which are so much in vogue at the present day;
and which are based upon our desire for a longer
conscious existence than that which nature appears
to have allotted to us. Perhaps he did not think
them worth notice. For indeed it is not a little
strange, that our strong desire that a certain occurrence
should happen should be put forward as
evidence that it will happen. If my intense desire
to see the friend, from whom I have parted, does
not bring him from the other side of the world, or
take me thither; if the mother's agonised prayer
that her child should live has not prevented him
from dying; experience certainly affords no presumption
that the strong desire to be alive after
death, which we call the aspiration after immortality,
is any more likely to be gratified. As Hume truly
says, "All doctrines are to be suspected which
are favoured by our passions"; and the doctrine,
that we are immortal because we should extremely
like to be so, contains the quintessence of suspiciousness.</p>

<p>If every man possessed everything he wanted,
and no one had the power to interfere with such
possession; or if no man desired that which could

<p>To fail in justice, or in benevolence, is to be
displeased with one's self. But happiness is impossible
without inward self-approval; and, hence, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>

welfare, will find his best reward in the practice of

<p>Virtue is undoubtedly beneficent; but the man is
to be envied to whom her ways seem in anywise
playful. And though she may not talk much about
suffering and self-denial, her silence on that topic
may be accounted for on the principle <i>&ccedil;a va sans

<p>If mankind cannot be engaged in practices "full
of austerity and rigour," by the love of righteousness
and the fear of evil, without seeking for other compensation
than that which flows from the gratification
of such love and the consciousness of escape
from debasement, they are in a bad case. For they
will assuredly find that virtue presents no very close
likeness to the sportive leader of the joyous hours in
Hume's rosy picture; but that she is an awful
Goddess, whose ministers are the Furies, and whose
highest reward is peace.</p>

<p>Under its theological aspect, morality is obedience
to the will of God; and the ground for such obedience
is two-fold: either we ought to obey God
because He will punish us if we disobey Him, which
is an argument based on the utility of obedience; or
our obedience ought to flow from our love towards
God, which is an argument based on pure feeling
and for which no reason can be given. For, if any
man should say that he takes no pleasure in the
contemplation of the ideal of perfect holiness, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in other words, that he does not love God, the
attempt to argue him into acquiring that pleasure
would be as hopeless as the endeavour to persuade
Peter Bell of the "witchery of the soft blue sky."</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXIV" id="Num_CLXIV">CLXIV</a></p>

<p>In whichever way we look at the matter, morality
is based on feeling, not on reason; though reason
alone is competent to trace out the effects of our
actions and thereby dictate conduct. Justice is
founded on the love of one's neighbour; and goodness
is a kind of beauty. The moral law, like the
laws of physical nature, rests in the long run upon
instinctive intuitions, and is neither more nor less
"innate" and "necessary" than they are. Some
people cannot by any means be got to understand
the first book of Euclid; but the truths of mathematics
are no less necessary and binding on the
great mass of mankind. Some there are who
cannot feel the difference between the "Sonata
Appassionata" and "Cherry Ripe"; or between a
grave-stone-cutter's cherub and the Apollo Belvidere;
but the canons of art are none the less acknowledged.
While some there may be, who, devoid of sympathy,
are incapable of a sense of duty; but neither does
their existence affect the foundations of morality.
Such pathological deviations from true manhood are
merely the halt, the lame, and the blind of the world
of consciousness; and the anatomist of the mind
leaves them aside, as the anatomist of the body
would ignore abnormal specimens.</p>

<p>And as there are Pascals and Mozarts, Newtons
and Raffaelles, in whom the innate faculty for science
or art seems to need but a touch to spring into full
vigour, and through whom the human race obtains
new possibilities of knowledge and new conceptions
of beauty: so there have been men of moral genius,
to whom we owe ideals of duty and visions of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
perfection, which ordinary mankind could never have
attained: though, happily for them, they can feel
the beauty of a vision, which lay beyond the reach
of their dull imaginations, and count life well spent
in shaping some faint image of it in the actual
world.</p>

<p>The horror of "Materialism" which weighs upon
the minds of so many excellent people appears to
depend, in part, upon the purely accidental connexion
of some forms of materialistic philosophy with ethical
and religious tenets by which they are repelled; and,
partly, on the survival of a very ancient superstition
concerning the nature of matter.</p>

<p>This superstition, for the tenacious vitality of
which the idealistic philosophers who are, more or
less, disciples of Plato and the theologians who have
been influenced by them, are responsible, assumes
that matter is something, not merely inert and
perishable, but essentially base and evil-natured, if
not actively antagonistic to, at least a negative dead-weight
upon, the good.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXVI" id="Num_CLXVI">CLXVI</a></p>

<p>Judging by contemporary literature, there are
numbers of highly cultivated and indeed superior
persons to whom the material world is altogether
contemptible; who can see nothing in a handful of
garden soil, or a rusty nail, but types of the passive
and the corruptible.</p>

<p>To modern science, these assumptions are as much
out of date as the equally venerable errors, that the
sun goes round the earth every four-and-twenty
hours, or that water is an elementary body. The
handful of soil is a factory thronged with swarms of
busy workers; the rusty nail is an aggregation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
millions of particles, moving with inconceivable
velocity in a dance of infinite complexity yet perfect
measure; harmonic with like performances throughout
the solar system. If there is good ground for
any conclusion, there is such for the belief that the
substance of these particles has existed and will
exist, that the energy which stirs them has persisted
and will persist, without assignable limit, either in
the past or the future. Surely, as Heracleitus said
of his kitchen with its pots and pans, "Here also
are the gods." Little as we have, even yet, learned
of the material universe, that little makes for the
belief that it is a system of unbroken order and
perfect symmetry, of which the form incessantly
changes, while the substance and the energy are
imperishable.</p>

<p>Of all the dangerous mental habits, that which
schoolboys call "cocksureness" is probably the most
perilous; and the inestimable value of metaphysical
discipline is that it furnishes an effectual counterpoise
to this evil proclivity. Whoso has mastered
the elements of philosophy knows that the attribute
of unquestionable certainty appertains only to the
existence of a state of consciousness so long as it
exists; all other beliefs are mere probabilities of a
higher or lower order. Sound metaphysic is an
amulet which renders its possessor proof alike
against the poison of superstition and the counter-poison
of shallow negation; by showing that the
affirmations of the former and the denials of the
latter alike deal with matters about which, for lack
of evidence, nothing can be either affirmed or
denied.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXVIII" id="Num_CLXVIII">CLXVIII</a></p>

<p>If the question is asked, What then do we know
about matter and motion? there is but one reply possible.
All that we know about motion is that it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
name for certain changes in the relations of our visual,
tactile, and muscular sensations; and all that we know
about matter is that it is the hypothetical substance
of physical phenomena, the assumption of the
existence of which is as pure a piece of metaphysical
speculation as is that of the existence of the
substance of mind.</p>

<p>Our sensations, our pleasures, our pains, and the
relations of these, make up the sum total of the
elements of positive, unquestionable knowledge.
We call a large section of these sensations and their
relations matter and motion; the rest we term mind
and thinking; and experience shows that there is a
certain constant order of succession between some
of the former and some of the latter.</p>

<p>This is all that just metaphysical criticism leaves
of the idols set up by the spurious metaphysics of
vulgar common sense. It is consistent either with
pure Materialism, or with pure Idealism, but it is
neither. For the Idealist, not content with declaring
the truth that our knowledge is limited to facts of
consciousness, affirms the wholly unprovable proposition
that nothing exists beyond these and the
substance of mind. And, on the other hand, the
Materialist, holding by the truth that, for anything
that appears to the contrary, material phenomena
are the causes of mental phenomena, asserts his
unprovable dogma, that material phenomena and
the substance of matter are the sole primary existences.
Strike out the propositions about which
neither controversialist does or can know anything,
and there is nothing left for them to quarrel about.
Make a desert of the Unknowable, and the divine

<p>To my observation, human nature has not sensibly
changed through the last thirty years. I doubt not
that there are truths as plainly obvious and as
generally denied, as those contained in "Man's
Place in Nature," now awaiting enunciation. If
there is a young man of the present generation, who
has taken as much trouble as I did to assure himself
that they are truths, let him come out with them,
without troubling his head about the barking of the
dogs of St. Ernulphus, "Veritas pr&aelig;valebit"&mdash;some
day; and, even if she does not prevail in his time, he
himself will be all the better and the wiser for having
tried to help her. And let him recollect that such
great reward is full payment for all his labour and
pains.</p>

<p>Ancient traditions, when tested by the severe
processes of modern investigations, commonly
enough fade away into mere dreams: but it is
singular how often the dream turns out to have been
a half-waking one, presaging a reality. Ovid
foreshadowed the discoveries of the geologist: the
Atlantis was an imagination, but Columbus found a
western world: and though the quaint forms of
Centaurs and Satyrs have an existence only in the
realms of art, creatures approaching man more nearly
than they in essential structure, and yet as thoroughly
brutal as the goat's or horse's half of the mythical
compound, are now not only known, but notorious.</p>

<p>It is a truth of very wide, if not of universal,
application, that every living creature commences its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
existence under a form different from, and simpler
than, that which it eventually attains.</p>

<p>The oak is a more complex thing than the little
rudimentary plant contained in the acorn; the
caterpillar is more complex than the egg; the
butterfly than the caterpillar; and each of these
beings, in passing from its rudimentary to its perfect
condition, runs through a series of changes, the sum
of which is called its development. In the higher
animals these changes are extremely complicated;
but, within the last half century, the labours of such
men as Von Baer, Rathke, Reichert, Bischoff, and
Remak, have almost completely unravelled them, so
that the successive stages of development which are
exhibited by a dog, for example, are now as well
known to the embryologist as are the steps of the
metamorphosis of the silkworm moth to the schoolboy.
It will be useful to consider with attention the
nature and the order of the stages of canine development,
as an example of the process in the higher
animals generally.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXXIII" id="Num_CLXXIII">CLXXIII</a></p>

<p>Exactly in those respects in which the developing
Man differs from the Dog, he resembles
the ape, which, like man, has a spheroidal yelk-sac
and a discoidal, sometimes partially lobed, placenta.
So that it is only quite in the later stages of development
that the young human being presents marked
differences from the young ape, while the latter
departs as much from the dog in its development, as
the man does.</p>

<p>Startling as the last assertion may appear to be, it
is demonstrably true, and it alone appears to me
sufficient to place beyond all doubt the structural
unity of man with the rest of the animal world, and
more particularly and closely with the apes.</p>

<p>Thus, identical in the physical processes by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
he originates&mdash;identical in the early stages of his
formation&mdash;identical in the mode of his nutrition
before and after birth, with the animals which lie
immediately below him in the scale&mdash;Man, if his
adult and perfect structure be compared with theirs,
exhibits, as might be expected, a marvellous likeness
of organisation. He resembles them as they resemble
one another&mdash;he differs from them as they differ from
one another.</p>

so complete and crushing an argument

intimate relations between Man and the rest of the
living world, and between the forces exerted by the
latter and all other forces, I can see no excuse for
doubting that all are co-ordinated terms of Nature's
great progression, from the formless to the formed&mdash;from

knowledge that Man is, in substance and in structure,
one with the brutes; for he alone possesses the
marvellous endowment of intelligible and rational
speech, whereby, in the secular period of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
existence, he has slowly accumulated and organised
the experience which is almost wholly lost with the
cessation of every individual life in other animals; so
that, now, he stands raised upon it as on a mountain
top, far above the level of his humble fellows, and
transfigured from his grosser nature by reflecting,
here and there, a ray from the infinite source of
truth.</p>

<p>Ethnology, as thus defined, is a branch of
Anthropology, the great science which unravels the
complexities of human structure; traces out the
relations of man to other animals; studies all that is
especially human in the mode in which man's complex
functions are performed; and searches after the
conditions which have determined his presence in the
world. And Anthropology is a section of Zoology,
which again is the animal half of Biology&mdash;the
science of life and living things.</p>

<p>Such is the position of ethnology, such are the
objects of the ethnologist. The paths or methods, by
following which he may hope to reach his goal, are
diverse. He may work at man from the point of
view of the pure zoologist, and investigate the
anatomical and physiological peculiarities of Negroes,
Australians, or Mongolians, just as he would inquire
into those of pointers, terriers, and turnspits,&mdash;"persistent
modifications" of man's almost universal
companion. Or he may seek aid from researches
into the most human manifestation of humanity&mdash;Language;
and assuming that what is true of speech
is true of the speaker&mdash;a hypothesis as questionable
in science as it is in ordinary life&mdash;he may apply to
mankind themselves the conclusions drawn from a
searching analysis of their words and grammatical
forms.</p>

<p>Or, the ethnologist may turn to the study of the
practical life of men; and relying upon the inherent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
conservatism and small inventiveness of untutored
mankind, he may hope to discover in manners and
customs, or in weapons, dwellings, and other handiwork,
a clue to the origin of the resemblances and
differences of nations. Or, he may resort to that
kind of evidence which is yielded by History proper,
and consists of the beliefs of men concerning past
events, embodied in traditional, or in written,
testimony. Or, when that thread breaks, Arch&aelig;ology,
which is the interpretation of the unrecorded
remains of man's works, belonging to the epoch
since the world has reached its present condition,
may still guide him. And, when even the dim light
of arch&aelig;ology fades, there yet remains Pal&aelig;ontology,
which, in these latter years, has brought to
daylight once more the exuvia of ancient populations,
whose world was not our world, who have been
buried in river beds immemorially dry, or carried by
the rush of waters into caves, inaccessible to inundation
since the dawn of tradition.</p>

<p>The rapid increase of natural knowledge, which
is the chief characteristic of our age, is effected in
various ways. The main army of science moves to
the conquest of new worlds slowly and surely,
nor ever cedes an inch of the territory gained. But
the advance is covered and facilitated by the ceaseless
activity of clouds of light troops provided with a
weapon&mdash;always efficient, if not always an arm of
precision&mdash;the scientific imagination. It is the
business of these <i>enfants perdus</i> of science to make
raids into the realm of ignorance wherever they
see, or think they see, a chance; and cheerfully to
accept defeat, or it may be annihilation, as the reward
of error. Unfortunately the public, which watches
the progress of the campaign, too often mistakes a
dashing incursion of the Uhlans for a forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
movement of the main body; fondly imagining that
the strategic movement to the rear, which occasionally
follows, indicates a battle lost by science.
And it must be confessed that the error is too often
justified by the effects of the irrepressible tendency
which men of science share with all other sorts of
men known to me, to be impatient of that most
wholesome state of mind&mdash;suspended judgment; to
assume the objective truth of speculations which,
from the nature of the evidence in their favour,
can have no claim to be more than working hypotheses.</p>

<p>The history of the "Aryan question" affords a
striking illustration of these general remarks.</p>

<p>Language is rooted half in the bodily and half in
the mental nature of man. The vocal sounds which
form the raw materials of language could not be
produced without a peculiar conformation of the
organs of speech; the enunciation of duly accented
syllables would be impossible without the nicest co-ordination
of the action of the muscles which move
these organs; and such co-ordination depends on the
mechanism of certain portions of the nervous system.
It is therefore conceivable that the structure of this
highly complex speaking apparatus should determine
a man's linguistic potentiality; that is to say, should
enable him to use a language of one class and not of
another. It is further conceivable that a particular
linguistic potentiality should be inherited and become
as good a race mark as any other. As a matter of
fact, it is not proven that the linguistic potentialities
of all men are the same.</p>

time or other, free and prolonged intercourse has

<p>The capacity of the population of Europe for
independent progress while in the copper and early
bronze stage&mdash;the "pal&aelig;o-metallic" stage, as it
might be called&mdash;appears to me to be demonstrated
in a remarkable manner by the remains of their
architecture. From the crannog to the elaborate
pile-dwelling, and from the rudest enclosure to the
complex fortification of the terramare, there is an
advance which is obviously a native product. So
with the sepulchral constructions; the stone cist, with
or without a preservative or memorial cairn, grows
into the chambered graves lodged in tumuli; into
such megalithic edifices as the dromic vaults of
Maes How and New Grange; to culminate in the
finished masonry of the tombs of Mycen&aelig;, constructed
on exactly the same plan. Can anyone look at the
varied series of forms which lie between the
primitive five or six flat stones fitted together into a
mere box, and such a building as Maes How, and
yet imagine that the latter is the result of foreign
tuition? But the men who built Maes How, without
metal tools, could certainly have built the so-called

time between the period at which North Europe was
first covered with ice, when savages pursued
mammoths and scratched their portraits with sharp
stones in central France, and the present day, ever
widens as we learn more about the events which
bridge it. And, if the differences between the
Neanderthaloid men and ourselves could be divided

<p>If the popular lecture thus, as I believe, finds one
moiety of its justification in the self-discipline of the
lecturer, it surely finds the other half in its effect on
the auditory. For though various sadly comical
experiences of the results of my own efforts have
led me to entertain a very moderate estimate of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
purely intellectual value of lectures; though I venture
to doubt if more than one in ten of an average
audience carries away an accurate notion of what
the speaker has been driving at; yet is that not
equally true of the oratory of the hustings, of the
House of Commons, and even of the pulpit?</p>

<p>Yet the children of this world are wise in their
generation; and both the politician and the priest
are justified by results. The living voice has an
influence over human action altogether independent
of the intellectual worth of that which it utters.
Many years ago, I was a guest at a great City
dinner. A famous orator, endowed with a voice of
rare flexibility and power; a born actor, ranging
with ease through every part, from refined comedy
to tragic unction, was called upon to reply to a
toast. The orator was a very busy man, a charming
conversationalist and by no means despised a good
dinner; and, I imagine, rose without having given
a thought to what he was going to say. The
rhythmic roll of sound was admirable, the gestures
perfect, the earnestness impressive; nothing was
lacking save sense and, occasionally, grammar.
When the speaker sat down the applause was
terrific and one of my neighbours was especially
enthusiastic. So when he had quieted down, I
asked him what the orator had said. And he could
not tell me.</p>

<p>That sagacious person John Wesley is reported
to have replied to some one who questioned the propriety
of his adaptation of sacred words to extremely
secular airs, that he did not see why the Devil should
be left in possession of all the best tunes. And I
do not see why science should not turn to account
the peculiarities of human nature thus exploited by
other agencies: all the more because science, by the
nature of its being, cannot desire to stir the passions,
or profit by the weaknesses, of human nature. The
most zealous of popular lecturers can aim at nothing
more than the awakening of a sympathy for abstract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
truth, in those who do not really follow his arguments;
and of a desire to know more and better in
the few who do.</p>

<p>At the same time it must be admitted that the
popularisation of science, whether by lecture or
essay, has its drawbacks. Success in this department
has its perils for those who succeed. The
"people who fail" take their revenge, as we have
recently had occasion to observe, by ignoring all
the rest of a man's work and glibly labelling him a
mere populariser. If the falsehood were not too
glaring, they would say the same of Faraday and
Helmholtz and Kelvin.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXXXVII" id="Num_CLXXXVII">CLXXXVII</a></p>

<p>Of the affliction caused by persons who think that
what they have picked up from popular exposition
qualifies them for discussing the great problems of
science, it may be said, as the Radical toast said of
the power of the Crown in bygone days, that it
"has increased, is increasing, and ought to be
diminished." The oddities of "English as she is
spoke" might be abundantly paralleled by those
of "Science as she is misunderstood" in the sermon,
the novel, and the leading article; and a collection
of the grotesque travesties of scientific conceptions,
in the shape of essays on such trifles as "the Nature
of Life" and the "Origin of All Things," which
reach me, from time to time, might well be bound
up with them.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CLXXXVIII" id="Num_CLXXXVIII">CLXXXVIII</a></p>

<p>The essay on Geological Reform unfortunately
brought me, I will not say into collision, but into
a position of critical remonstrance with regard
to some charges of physical heterodoxy, brought
by my distinguished friend Lord Kelvin, against
British Geology. As President of the Geological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Society of London at that time (1869), I thought
I might venture to plead that we were not such
heretics as we seemed to be; and that, even if we
were, recantation would not affect the question of
evolution.</p>

<p>I am glad to see that Lord Kelvin has just
reprinted his reply to my plea, and I refer the
reader to it. I shall not presume to question anything,
that on such ripe consideration, Lord Kelvin
has to say upon the physical problems involved.
But I may remark that no one can have asserted
more strongly than I have done, the necessity
of looking to physics and mathematics, for help
in regard to the earliest history of the globe.</p>

<p>And I take the opportunity of repeating the
opinion that, whether what we call geological
time has the lower limit assigned to it by Lord
Kelvin, or the higher assumed by other philosophers;
whether the germs of all living things have originated
in the globe itself, or whether they have been
imported on, or in, meteorites from without, the
problem of the origin of those successive Faun&aelig;
and Flor&aelig; of the earth, the existence of which is
fully demonstrated by pal&aelig;ontology, remains exactly
where it was.</p>

<p>For I think it will be admitted, that the germs
brought to us by meteorites, if any, were not ova
of elephants, nor of crocodiles; not cocoa-nuts nor
acorns; not even eggs of shell-fish and corals;
but only those of the lowest forms of animal and
vegetable life. Therefore, since it is proved that,
from a very remote epoch of geological time, the
earth has been peopled by a continual succession
of the higher forms of animals and plants, these
either must have been created, or they have arisen
by evolution. And in respect of certain groups of
animals, the well-established facts of pal&aelig;ontology
leave no rational doubt that they arose by the latter
method.</p>

<p>In the second place, there are no data whatever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
which justify the biologist in assigning any,
even approximately definite, period of time, either
long or short, to the evolution of one species from
another by the process of variation and selection.
In the essay on Geological Contemporaneity and
Persistent Types of Life I have taken pains to
prove that the change of animals has gone on
at very different rates in different groups of living
beings; that some types have persisted with little
change from the pal&aelig;ozoic epoch till now, while
others have changed rapidly within the limits
of an epoch. In 1862 (see Coll. Ess. viii. pp. 303, 304) in
1863 (vol. ii., p. 461) and again in 1864 (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 89-91)
I argued, not as a matter of speculation, but from
pal&aelig;ontological facts, the bearing of which I believe,
up to that time, had not been shown, that any
adequate hypothesis of the causes of evolution must
be consistent with progression, stationariness and
retrogression, of the same type at different epochs;
of different types in the same epoch; and that
Darwin's hypothesis fulfilled these conditions.</p>

<p>According to that hypothesis, two factors are at
work, variation and selection. Next to nothing is
known of the causes of the former process; nothing
whatever of the time required for the production
of a certain amount of deviation from the existing
type. And, as respects selection, which operates
by extinguishing all but a small minority of
variations, we have not the slightest means of
estimating the rapidity with which it does its work.
All that we are justified in saying is that the rate
at which it takes place may vary almost indefinitely.
If the famous paint-root of Florida, which kills
white pigs but not black ones, were abundant
and certain in its action, black pigs might be
substituted for white in the course of two or
three years. If, on the other hand, it was rare
and uncertain in action, the white pigs might linger
on for centuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>A great chapter of the history of the world is
written in the chalk. Few passages in the history
of man can be supported by such an overwhelming
mass of direct and indirect evidence as that
which testifies to the truth of the fragment of the
history of the globe, which I hope to enable you
to read, with your own eyes, to-night. Let me
add, that few chapters of human history have a
more profound significance for ourselves. I weigh
my words well when I assert, that the man who
should know the true history of the bit of chalk
which every carpenter carries about in his
breeches-pocket, though ignorant of all other
history, is likely, if he will think his knowledge
out to its ultimate results, to have a truer, and
therefore a better, conception of this wonderful
universe, and of man's relation to it, than the
most learned student who is deep-read in the
records of humanity and ignorant of those of
Nature.</p>

<p>The examination of a transparent slice gives a
good notion of the manner in which the components
of the chalk are arranged, and of their relative proportions.
But, by rubbing up some chalk with a
brush in water and then pouring off the milky fluid,
so as to obtain sediments of different degrees of fineness,
the granules and the minute rounded bodies
may be pretty well separated from one another, and
submitted to microscopic examination, either as
opaque or as transparent objects. By combining the
views obtained in these various methods, each of
the rounded bodies may be proved to be a beautifully-constructed
calcareous fabric, made up of a number
of chambers, communicating freely with one another.
The chambered bodies are of various forms. One of
the commonest is something like a badly-grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
raspberry, being formed of a number of nearly
globular chambers of different sizes congregated
together. It is called <i>Globigerina</i>, and some specimens
of chalk consist of little else than <i>Globigerin&aelig;</i>
and granules. Let us fix our attention upon the
<i>Globigerina</i>. It is the spoor of the game we are
tracking. If we can learn what it is and what are
the conditions of its existence, we shall see our way
to the origin and past history of the chalk.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCI" id="Num_CXCI">CXCI</a></p>

<p>It so happens that calcareous skeletons, exactly
similar to the <i>Globigerin&aelig;</i> of the chalk, are being
formed, at the present moment, by minute living
creatures, which flourish in multitudes, literally
more numerous than the sands of the sea-shore, over
a large extent of that part of the earth's surface
which is covered by the ocean.</p>

<p>The history of the discovery of these living
<i>Globigerin&aelig;</i>, and of the part which they play in rock
building, is singular enough. It is a discovery
which, like others of no less scientific importance,
has arisen, incidentally, out of work devoted to very
different and exceedingly practical interests. When
men first took to the sea, they speedily learned to
look out for shoals and rocks; and the more the
burthen of their ships increased, the more imperatively
necessary it became for sailors to ascertain
with precision the depth of the waters they traversed.
Out of this necessity grew the use of the lead and
sounding line; and, ultimately, marine-surveying,
which is the recording of the form of coasts and of
the depth of the sea, as ascertained by the sounding-lead,
upon charts.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCII" id="Num_CXCII">CXCII</a></p>

<p>Lieut. Brooke, of the American Navy, some years
ago invented a most ingenious machine, by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
a considerable portion of the superficial layer
of the sea-bottom can be scooped out and brought up
from any depth to which the lead descends. In 1853,
Lieut. Brooke obtained mud from the bottom of the
North Atlantic, between Newfoundland and the
Azores, at a depth of more than 10,000 feet, or two
miles, by the help of this sounding apparatus. The
specimens were sent for examination to Ehrenberg
of Berlin, and to Bailey of West Point, and those
able microscopists found that this deep-sea mud was
almost entirely composed of the skeletons of living
organisms&mdash;the greater proportion of these being
just like the <i>Globigerin&aelig;</i> already known to occur in
the chalk.</p>

<p>Thus far, the work had been carried on simply in
the interests of science, but Lieut. Brooke's method
of sounding acquired a high commercial value, when
the enterprise of laying down the telegraph-cable
between this country and the United States was
undertaken. For it became a matter of immense
importance to know, not only the depth of the sea
over the whole line along which the cable was to be
laid, but the exact nature of the bottom, so as to
guard against chances of cutting or fraying the
strands of that costly rope. The Admiralty consequently
ordered Captain Dayman, an old friend and
shipmate of mine, to ascertain the depth over the
whole line of the cable, and to bring back specimens
of the bottom. In former days, such a command as
this might have sounded very much like one of the
impossible things which the young Prince in the
Fairy Tales is ordered to do before he can obtain
the hand of the Princess. However, in the months
of June and July, 1857, my friend performed the task
assigned to him with great expedition and precision,
without, so far as I know, having met with any
reward of that kind. The specimens of Atlantic mud
which he procured were sent to me to be examined
and reported upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCIII" id="Num_CXCIII">CXCIII</a></p>

<p>The result of all these operations is, that we know
the contours and the nature of the surface-soil
covered by the North Atlantic for a distance of 1,700
miles from east to west, as well as we know that of
any part of the dry land. It is a prodigious plain&mdash;one
of the widest and most even plains in the world.
If the sea were drained off, you might drive a
waggon all the way from Valentia, on the west
coast of Ireland, to Trinity Bay in Newfoundland.
And, except upon one sharp incline about 200 miles
from Valentia, I am not quite sure that it would
even be necessary to put the skid on, so gentle are
the ascents and descents upon that long route.
From Valentia the road would lie down-hill for
about 200 miles to the point at which the bottom is
now covered by 1,700 fathoms of sea-water. Then
would come the central plain, more than a thousand
miles wide, the inequalities of the surface of which
would be hardly perceptible, though the depth of
water upon it now varies from 10,000 to 15,000 feet;
and there are places in which Mont Blanc might be
sunk without showing its peak above water. Beyond
this, the ascent on the American side commences,
and gradually leads, for about 300 miles, to the
Newfoundland shore.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCIV" id="Num_CXCIV">CXCIV</a></p>

<p>When we consider that the remains of more than
three thousand distinct species of aquatic animals
have been discovered among the fossils of the chalk,
that the great majority of them are of such forms as
are now met with only in the sea, and that there is
no reason to believe that any one of them inhabited
fresh water&mdash;the collateral evidence that the chalk
represents an ancient sea-bottom acquires as great
force as the proof derived from the nature of the
chalk itself. I think you will now allow that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
did not overstate my case when I asserted that we
have as strong grounds for believing that all the
vast area of dry land, at present occupied by the
chalk, was once at the bottom of the sea, as we have
for any matter of history whatever; while there is
no justification for any other belief.</p>

<p>No less certain it is that the time during which the
countries we now call south-east England, France,
Germany, Poland, Russia, Egypt, Arabia, Syria,
were more or less completely covered by a deep sea,
was of considerable duration. We have already
seen that the chalk is, in places, more than a thousand
feet thick. I think you will agree with me
that it must have taken some time for the skeletons
of animalcules of a hundredth of an inch in diameter
to heap up such a mass as that.</p>

<p>If the decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin;
the attachment, growth to maturity, and decay
of the <i>Crania</i>; and the subsequent attachment and
growth of the coralline, took a year (which is a low
estimate enough), the accumulation of the inch of
chalk must have taken more than a year: and the
deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must, consequently,
have taken more than twelve thousand
years.</p>

<p>There is a writing upon the wall of cliffs at
Cromer, and whoso runs may read it. It tells us,
with an authority which cannot be impeached, that
the ancient sea-bed of the chalk sea was raised up,
and remained dry land, until it was covered with
forest, stocked with the great game the spoils of
which have rejoiced your geologists. How long it
remained in that condition cannot be said; but "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
whirligig of time brought its revenges" in those
days as in these. That dry land, with the bones
and teeth of generations of long-lived elephants,
hidden away among the gnarled roots and dry
leaves of its ancient trees, sank gradually to the
bottom of the icy sea, which covered it with huge
masses of drift and boulder clay. Sea-beasts, such
as the walrus, now restricted to the extreme north,
paddled about where birds had twittered among the
topmost twigs of the fir-trees. How long this state
of things endured we know not, but at length it
came to an end. The upheaved glacial mud hardened
into the soil of modern Norfolk. Forests grew
once more, the wolf and the beaver replaced the
reindeer and the elephant; and at length what we
call the history of England dawned.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCVII" id="Num_CXCVII">CXCVII</a></p>

<p>Direct proof may be given that some parts of the
land of the northern hemisphere are at this moment
insensibly rising and others insensibly sinking; and
there is indirect, but perfectly satisfactory, proof,
that an enormous area now covered by the Pacific
has been deepened thousands of feet, since the present
inhabitants of that sea came into existence.
Thus there is not a shadow of a reason for believing
that the physical changes of the globe, in past times,
have been effected by other than natural causes.</p>

<p>A small beginning has led us to a great ending.
If I were to put the bit of chalk with which we
started into the hot but obscure flame of burning
hydrogen, it would presently shine like the sun. It
seems to me that this physical metamorphosis is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
false image of what has been the result of our
subjecting it to a jet of fervent, though nowise
brilliant, thought to-night. It has become luminous,
and its clear rays, penetrating the abyss of the
remote past, have brought within our ken some
stages of the evolution of the earth. And in the
shifting "without haste, but without rest" of the
land and sea, as in the endless variation of the forms
assumed by living beings, we have observed nothing
but the natural product of the forces originally
possessed by the substance of the universe.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CXCIX" id="Num_CXCIX">CXCIX</a></p>

<p>In certain parts of the sea bottom in the immediate
vicinity of the British Islands, as in the Clyde
district, among the Hebrides, in the Moray Firth,
and in the German Ocean, there are depressed are&aelig;,
forming a kind of submarine valleys, the centres of
which are from 80 to 100 fathoms, or more, deep.
These depressions are inhabited by assemblages of
marine animals, which differ from those found over
the adjacent and shallower region, and resemble
those which are met with much farther north, on the
Norwegian coast. Forbes called these Scandinavian
detachments "Northern outliers."</p>

<p>How did these isolated patches of a northern
population get into these deep places? To explain
the mystery, Forbes called to mind the fact that, in
the epoch which immediately preceded the present,
the climate was much colder (whence the name of
"glacial epoch" applied to it); and that the shells
which are found fossil, or sub-fossil, in deposits of
that age are precisely such as are now to be met
with only in the Scandinavian, or still more Arctic,
regions. Undoubtedly, during the glacial epoch,
the general population of our seas had, universally,
the northern aspect which is now presented only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
by the "northern outliers"; just as the vegetation
of the land, down to the sea-level, had the northern
character which is, at present, exhibited only by the
plants which live on the tops of our mountains.
But, as the glacial epoch passed away, and the
present climatal conditions were developed, the
northern plants were able to maintain themselves
only on the bleak heights, on which southern forms
could not compete with them. And, in like manner,
Forbes suggested that, after the glacial epoch, the
northern animals then inhabiting the sea became
restricted to the deeps in which they could hold
their own against invaders from the south, better
fitted than they to flourish in the warmer waters of
the shallows. Thus depth in the sea corresponded
in its effect upon distribution to height on the
land.</p>

<p>Among the scientific instructions for the voyage<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
drawn up by a committee of the Royal Society,
there is a remarkable letter from Von Humboldt
to Lord Minto, then First Lord of the Admiralty,
in which, among other things, he dwells upon
the significance of the researches into the microscopic
composition of rocks, and the discovery
of the great share which microscopic organisms
take in the formation of the crust of the earth at
the present day, made by Ehrenberg in the years
1836-39. Ehrenberg, in fact, had shown that the
extensive beds of "rotten-stone" or "Tripoli"
which occur in various parts of the world, and
notably at Bilin in Bohemia, consisted of accumulations
of the silicious cases and skeletons of
<i>Diatomace&aelig;</i>, sponges, and <i>Radiolaria</i>; he had proved
that similar deposits were being formed by <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i>,
in the pools of the Thiergarten in Berlin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
elsewhere, and had pointed out that, if it were
commercially worth while, rotten-stone might be
manufactured by a process of diatom-culture. Observations
conducted at Cuxhaven, in 1839, had
revealed the existence, at the surface of the waters
of the Baltic, of living Diatoms and <i>Radiolaria</i>
of the same species as those which, in a fossil
state, constitute extensive rocks of tertiary age at
Caltanisetta, Zante, and Oran, on the shores of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the fresh-water rotten-stone beds
of Bilin, Ehrenberg had traced out the metamorphosis,
effected apparently by the action of percolating
water, of the primitively loose and friable
deposit of organized particles, in which the silex
exists in the hydrated or soluble condition. The
silex, in fact, undergoes solution and slow redeposition,
until, in ultimate result, the excessively fine-grained
sand, each particle of which is a skeleton,
becomes converted into a dense opaline stone, with
only here and there an indication of an organism.</p>

<p>From the consideration of these facts, Ehrenberg,
as early as the year 1839, had arrived at the conclusion
that rocks, altogether similar to those which
constitute a large part of the crust of the earth,
must be forming, at the present day, at the bottom
of the sea; and he threw out the suggestion that
even where no trace of organic structure is to be
found in the older rocks, it may have been lost by
metamorphosis.</p>

<p>It is highly creditable to the ingenuity of our
ancestors that the peculiar property of fermented
liquids, in virtue of which they "make glad the
heart of man," seems to have been known in the
remotest periods of which we have any record. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
savages take to alcoholic fluids as if they were to
the manner born. Our Vedic forefathers intoxicated
themselves with the juice of the "soma"; Noah,
by a not unnatural reaction against a superfluity of
water, appears to have taken the earliest practicable
opportunity of qualifying that which he was obliged
to drink; and the ghosts of the ancient Egyptians
were solaced by pictures of banquets in which the
wine-cup passes round, graven on the walls of their
tombs. A knowledge of the process of fermentation,
therefore, was in all probability possessed by the
prehistoric populations of the globe; and it must
have become a matter of great interest even to
prim&aelig;val wine-bibbers to study the methods by
which fermented liquids could be surely manufactured.
No doubt it was soon discovered that the most
certain, as well as the most expeditious, way of
making a sweet juice ferment was to add to it a
little of the scum, or lees, of another fermenting
juice. And it can hardly be questioned that this
singular excitation of fermentation in one fluid, by a
sort of infection, or inoculation, of a little ferment
taken from some other fluid, together with the
strange swelling, foaming, and hissing of the
fermented substance, must have always attracted
attention from the more thoughtful. Nevertheless,
the commencement of the scientific analysis of the
phenomena dates from a period not earlier than the
first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>At this time, Van Helmont made a first step, by
pointing out that the peculiar hissing and bubbling
of a fermented liquid is due, not to the evolution of
common air (which he, as the inventor of the term
"gas," calls "gas ventosum"), but to that of a
peculiar kind of air such as is occasionally met with
in caves, mines, and wells, and which he calls "gas
sylvestre."</p>

<p>But a century elapsed before the nature of this
"gas sylvestre," or, as it was afterwards called,
"fixed air," was clearly determined, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
found to be identical with that deadly "chokedamp"
by which the lives of those who descend into
old wells, or mines, or brewers' vats, are sometimes
suddenly ended; and with the poisonous ariform
fluid which is produced by the combustion of charcoal,
and now goes by the name of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>During the same time it gradually became evident
that the presence of sugar was essential to the
production of alcohol and the evolution of carbonic
acid gas, which are the two great and conspicuous
products of fermentation. And finally, in 1787, the
Italian chemist, Fabroni, made the capital discovery
that the yeast ferment, the presence of which is
necessary to fermentation, is what he termed a
"vegeto-animal" substance; that is, a body which
gives off ammoniacal salts when it is burned, and is,
in other ways, similar to the gluten of plants and
the albumen and casein of animals.</p>

<p>The living club-mosses are, for the most part,
insignificant and creeping herbs, which, superficially,
very closely resemble true mosses, and none of them
reach more than two or three feet in height. But,
in their essential structure, they very closely resemble
the earliest Lepidodendroid trees of the coal: their
stems and leaves are similar; so are their cones;
and no less like are the sporangia and spores; while
even in their size, the spores of the <i>Lepidodendron</i> and
those of the existing <i>Lycopodium</i>, or club-moss, very
closely approach one another.</p>

<p>Thus, the singular conclusion is forced upon us,
that the greater and the smaller sacs of the "Better-Bed"
and other coals, in which the primitive structure
is well preserved, are simply the sporangia and
spores of certain plants, many of which were closely
allied to the existing club-mosses. And if, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
believe, it can be demonstrated that ordinary coal is
nothing but "saccular" coal which has undergone
a certain amount of that alteration which, if continued,
would convert it into anthracite; then, the
conclusion is obvious, that the great mass of the coal
we burn is the result of the accumulation of the
spores and spore-cases of plants, other parts of which
have furnished the carbonized stems and the mineral
charcoal, or have left their impressions on the surfaces
of the layer.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCIII" id="Num_CCIII">CCIII</a></p>

<p>The position of the beds which constitute the coal-measures
is infinitely diverse. Sometimes they are
tilted up vertically, sometimes they are horizontal,
sometimes curved into great basins; sometimes they
come to the surface, sometimes they are covered up
by thousands of feet of rock. But, whatever their
present position, there is abundant and conclusive
evidence that every under-clay was once a surface
soil. Not only do carbonized root-fibres frequently
abound in these under-clays; but the stools of trees,
the trunks of which are broken off and confounded
with the bed of coal, have been repeatedly found
passing into radiating roots, still embedded in the
under-clay. On many parts of the coast of England,
what are commonly known as "submarine forests"
are to be seen at low water. They consist, for the
most part, of short stools of oak, beech, and fir-trees,
still fixed by their long roots in the bed of blue clay in
which they originally grew. If one of these submarine
forest beds should be gradually depressed and
covered up by new deposits, it would present just
the same characters as an under-clay of the coal, if
the <i>Sigillaria</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i> of the ancient world
were substituted for the oak, or the beech, of our
own times.</p>

<p>In a tropical forest, at the present day, the trunks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of fallen trees, and the stools of such trees as may
have been broken by the violence of storms, remain
entire for but a short time. Contrary to what might
be expected, the dense wood of the tree decays, and
suffers from the ravages of insects, more swiftly
than the bark. And the traveller, setting his foot on
a prostrate trunk finds that it is a mere shell, which
breaks under his weight, and lands his foot amidst the
insects, or the reptiles, which have sought food or
refuge within.</p>

<p>The coal accumulated upon the area covered by
one of the great forests of the carboniferous epoch
would, in course of time, have been wasted away by
the small, but constant, wear and tear of rain and
streams, had the land which supported it remained at
the same level, or been gradually raised to a greater
elevation. And, no doubt, as much coal as now
exists has been destroyed, after its formation, in this
way.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCV" id="Num_CCV">CCV</a></p>

<p>Once more, an invariably-recurring lesson of
geological history, at whatever point its study is
taken up: the lesson of the almost infinite slowness
of the modification of living forms. The lines of the
pedigrees of living things break off almost before
they begin to converge.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCVI" id="Num_CCVI">CCVI</a></p>

<p>Yet another curious consideration. Let us suppose
that one of the stupid, salamander-like Labyrinthodonts,
which pottered, with much belly and
little leg, like Falstaff in his old age, among the
coal-forests, could have had thinking power enough
in his small brain to reflect upon the showers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
spores which kept on falling through years and
centuries, while perhaps not one in ten million
fulfilled its apparent purpose, and reproduced the
organism which gave it birth: surely he might have
been excused for moralizing upon the thoughtless and
wanton extravagance which Nature displayed in her
operations.</p>

<p>But we have the advantage over our shovelheaded
predecessor&mdash;or possibly ancestor&mdash;and can
perceive that a certain vein of thrift runs through this
apparent prodigality. Nature is never in a hurry,
and seems to have had always before her eyes the
adage, "Keep a thing long enough, and you will
find a use for it." She has kept her beds of coal
many millions of years without being able to find
much use for them; she has sent them down beneath
the sea, and the sea-beasts could make nothing of
them; she has raised them up into dry land, and laid
the black veins bare, and still, for ages and ages,
there was no living thing on the face of the earth
that could see any sort of value in them; and it was
only the other day, so to speak, that she turned a
new creature out of her workshop, who by degrees
acquired sufficient wits to make a fire, and then
to discover that the black rock would burn.</p>

<p>I suppose that nineteen hundred years ago, when
Julius C&aelig;sar was good enough to deal with Britain as
we have dealt with New Zealand, the prim&aelig;val
Briton, blue with cold and woad, may have known
that the strange black stone, of which he found lumps
here and there in his wanderings, would burn, and so
help to warm his body and cook his food. Saxon,
Dane, and Norman swarmed into the land. The
English people grew into a powerful nation, and
Nature still waited for a full return of the capital she
had invested in the ancient club-mosses. The
eighteenth century arrived, and with it James Watt.
The brain of that man was the spore out of which
was developed the modern steam-engine, and all the
prodigious trees and branches of modern industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
which have grown out of this. But coal is as much
an essential condition of this growth and development
as carbonic acid is for that of a club-moss. Wanting
coal, we could not have smelted the iron needed
to make our engines, nor have worked our engines
when we had got them. But take away the
engines, and the great towns of Yorkshire and
Lancashire vanish like a dream. Manufactures give
place to agriculture and pasture, and not ten men
can live where now ten thousand are amply supported.</p>

<p>Thus, all this abundant wealth of money and of
vivid life is Nature's interest upon her investment in
club-mosses, and the like, so long ago. But what
becomes of the coal which is burnt in yielding this
interest? Heat comes out of it, light comes out of
it; and if we could gather together all that goes up
the chimney, and all that remains in the grate of a
thoroughly-burnt coal-fire, we should find ourselves
in possession of a quantity of carbonic acid, water,
ammonia, and mineral matters, exactly equal in
weight to the coal. But these are the very matters
with which Nature supplied the club-mosses which
made the coal. She is paid back principal and
interest at the same time; and she straightway
invests the carbonic acid, the water, and the ammonia
in new forms of life, feeding with them the plants
that now live. Thrifty Nature! Surely no prodigal,
but most notable of housekeepers!</p>

<p>Here, then, is a capital fact. The movements of
the lobster are due to muscular contractility. But
why does a muscle contract at one time and not at
another? Why does one whole group of muscles
contract when the lobster wishes to extend his tail,
and another group when he desires to bend it?
What is it originates, directs, and controls the motive
power?</p>

<p>Experiment, the great instrument for the ascertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of truth in physical science, answers this
question for us. In the head of the lobster there lies
a small mass of that peculiar tissue which is known
as nervous substance. Cords of similar matter
connect this brain of the lobster, directly or indirectly,
with the muscles. Now, if these communicating
cords are cut, the brain remaining entire, the power
of exerting what we call voluntary motion in the
parts below the section is destroyed; and, on the
other hand, if, the cords remaining entire, the brain
mass be destroyed, the same voluntary mobility is
equally lost. Whence the inevitable conclusion is,
that the power of originating these motions resides
in the brain and is propagated along the nervous
cords.</p>

<p>In the higher animals the phenomena which attend
this transmission have been investigated, and the
exertion of the peculiar energy which resides in the
nerves has been found to be accompanied by a
disturbance of the electrical state of their molecules.</p>

<p>If we could exactly estimate the signification of
this disturbance; if we could obtain the value of
a given exertion of nerve force by determining the
quantity of electricity, or of heat, of which it is
the equivalent; if we could ascertain upon what
arrangement, or other condition of the molecules of
matter, the manifestation of the nervous and
muscular energies depends (and doubtless science
will some day or other ascertain these points),
physiologists would have attained their ultimate
goal in this direction; they would have determined
the relation of the motive force of animals to the
other forms of force found in nature; and if the
same process had been successfully performed for
all the operations which are carried on in, and by,
the animal frame, physiology would be perfect, and
the facts of morphology and distribution would be
deducible from the laws which physiologists had
established, combined with those determining the
condition of the surrounding universe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of lectures is, in the first place, to
awaken the attention and excite the enthusiasm
of the student; and this, I am sure, may be effected
to a far greater extent by the oral discourse and
by the personal influence of a respected teacher
than in any other way. Secondly, lectures have
the double use of guiding the student to the salient
points of a subject, and at the same time forcing
him to attend to the whole of it, and not merely
to that part which takes his fancy. And lastly,
lectures afford the student the opportunity of
seeking explanations of those difficulties which
will, and indeed ought to, arise in the course of
his studies.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCIX" id="Num_CCIX">CCIX</a></p>

<p>What books shall I read? is a question constantly
put by the student to the teacher. My
reply usually is, "None: write your notes out
carefully and fully; strive to understand them
thoroughly; come to me for the explanation of
anything you cannot understand; and I would
rather you did not distract your mind by reading."
A properly composed course of lectures ought to
contain fully as much matter as a student can
assimilate in the time occupied by its delivery;
and the teacher should always recollect that his
business is to feed and not to cram the intellect.
Indeed, I believe that a student who gains from
a course of lectures the simple habit of concentrating
his attention upon a definitely limited series
of facts, until they are thoroughly mastered, has
made a step of immeasurable importance.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCX" id="Num_CCX">CCX</a></p>

<p>However good lectures may be, and however
extensive the course of reading by which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
are followed up, they are but accessories to the
great instrument of scientific teaching&mdash;demonstration.
If I insist unweariedly, nay fanatically,
upon the importance of physical science as an
educational agent, it is because the study of any
branch of science, if properly conducted, appears
to me to fill up a void left by all other means of
education. I have the greatest respect and love
for literature; nothing would grieve me more than
to see literary training other than a very prominent
branch of education: indeed, I wish that real literary
discipline were far more attended to than it is; but
I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is a
vast difference between men who have had a purely
literary, and those who have had a sound scientific,
training.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXI" id="Num_CCXI">CCXI</a></p>

<p>In the world of letters, learning and knowledge
are one, and books are the source of both; whereas
in science, as in life, learning and knowledge are
distinct, and the study of things, and not of books, is
the source of the latter.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXII" id="Num_CCXII">CCXII</a></p>

<p>All that literature has to bestow may be obtained
by reading and by practical exercise in writing
and in speaking; but I do not exaggerate when
I say that none of the best gifts of science are to
be won by these means. On the contrary, the
great benefit which a scientific education bestows,
whether as training or as knowledge, is dependent
upon the extent to which the mind of the student
is brought into immediate contact with facts&mdash;upon
the degree to which he learns the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
appealing directly to Nature, and of acquiring through
his senses concrete images of those properties of
things, which are, and always will be, but approximatively
expressed in human language. Our way
of looking at Nature, and of speaking about her,
varies from year to year; but a fact once seen,
a relation of cause and effect, once demonstratively
apprehended, are possessions which neither change
nor pass away, but, on the contrary, form fixed
centres, about which other truths aggregate by
natural affinity.</p>

<p>Therefore, the great business of the scientific
teacher is, to imprint the fundamental, irrefragable
facts of his science, not only by words upon the
mind, but by sensible impressions upon the eye,
and ear, and touch of the student, in so complete
a manner, that every term used, or law enunciated,
should afterwards call up vivid images of the
particular structural, or other, facts which furnished
the demonstration of the law, or the illustration
of the term.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXIII" id="Num_CCXIII">CCXIII</a></p>

<p>What is the purpose of primary intellectual
education? I apprehend that its first object is to
train the young in the use of those tools wherewith
men extract knowledge from the ever-shifting
succession of phenomena which pass before their
eyes; and that its second object is to inform them
of the fundamental laws which have been found
by experience to govern the course of things, so
that they may not be turned out into the world
naked, defenceless, and a prey to the events they
might control.</p>

<p>A boy is taught to read his own and other
languages, in order that he may have access to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
infinitely wider stores of knowledge than could
ever be opened to him by oral intercourse with his
fellow men; he learns to write, that his means of
communication with the rest of mankind may be
indefinitely enlarged, and that he may record and
store up the knowledge he acquires. He is taught
elementary mathematics, that he may understand
all those relations of number and form, upon which
the transactions of men, associated in complicated
societies, are built, and that he may have some
practice in deductive reasoning.</p>

<p>All these operations of reading, writing, and
ciphering are intellectual tools, whose use should,
before all things, be learned, and learned thoroughly;
so that the youth may be enabled to
make his life that which it ought to be, a continual
progress in learning and in wisdom.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXIV" id="Num_CCXIV">CCXIV</a></p>

<p>In addition, primary education endeavours to
fit a boy out with a certain equipment of positive
knowledge. He is taught the great laws of morality;
the religion of his sect; so much history and
geography as will tell him where the great countries
of the world are, what they are, and how they have
become what they are.</p>

<p>But if I regard it closely, a curious reflection
arises. I suppose that, fifteen hundred years ago,
the child of any well-to-do Roman citizen was
taught just these same things; reading and writing
in his own, and, perhaps, the Greek tongue; the
elements of mathematics; and the religion, morality,
history, and geography current in his time.
Furthermore, I do not think I err in affirming that,
if such a Christian Roman boy, who had finished
his education, could be transplanted into one of our
public schools, and pass through its course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
instruction, he would not meet with a single
unfamiliar line of thought; amidst all the new facts
he would have to learn, not one would suggest a
different mode of regarding the universe from that
current in his own time.</p>

<p>And yet surely there is some great difference
between the civilisation of the fourth century and
that of the nineteenth, and still more between the
intellectual habits and tone of thought of that day
and this?</p>

<p>And what has made this difference? I answer
fearlessly&mdash;The prodigious development of physical
science within the last two centuries.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXV" id="Num_CCXV">CCXV</a></p>

<p>Modern civilisation rests upon physical science;
take away her gifts to our own country, and our
position among the leading nations of the world
is gone to-morrow; for it is physical science only
that makes intelligence and moral energy stronger
than brute force.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXVI" id="Num_CCXVI">CCXVI</a></p>

<p>The whole of modern thought is steeped in
science; it has made its way into the works of
our best poets, and even the mere man of letters,
who affects to ignore and despise science, is unconsciously
impregnated with her spirit, and indebted
for his best products to her methods. I
believe that the greatest intellectual revolution
mankind has yet seen is now slowly taking place
by her agency. She is teaching the world that
the ultimate court of appeal is observation and
experiment, and not authority; she is teaching it
to estimate the value of evidence; she is creating
a firm and living faith in the existence of immutable
moral and physical laws, perfect obedience to
which is the highest possible aim of an intelligent
being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>But of all this your old stereotyped system of
education takes no note. Physical science, its
methods, its problems, and its difficulties, will meet
the poorest boy at every turn, and yet we educate
him in such a manner that he shall enter the world
as ignorant of the existence of the methods and
facts of science as the day he was born. The
modern world is full of artillery; and we turn out
our children to do battle in it, equipped with the
shield and sword of an ancient gladiator.</p>

<p>Posterity will cry shame on us if we do not remedy
this deplorable state of things. Nay, if we live
twenty years longer, our own consciences will cry
shame on us.</p>

<p>It is my firm conviction that the only way to
remedy it is to make the elements of physical science
an integral part of primary education. I have
endeavoured to show you how that may be done for
that branch of science which it is my business to pursue;
and I can but add, that I should look upon the day
when every schoolmaster throughout this land was a
centre of genuine, however rudimentary, scientific
knowledge as an epoch in the history of the country.</p>

<p>But let me entreat you to remember my last words.
Addressing myself to you, as teachers, I would say,
mere book learning in physical science is a sham and
a delusion&mdash;what you teach, unless you wish to be
impostors, that you must first know; and real
knowledge in science means personal acquaintance
with the facts, be they few or many.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXVIII" id="Num_CCXVIII">CCXVIII</a></p>

<p>The first distinct enunciation of the hypothesis
that all living matter has sprung from pre-existing
living matter came from a contemporary, though a
junior, of Harvey, a native of that country, fertile in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
men great in all departments of human activity,
which was to intellectual Europe, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, what Germany is in the
nineteenth. It was in Italy, and from Italian
teachers, that Harvey received the most important
part of his scientific education. And it was a student
trained in the same schools, Francesco Redi&mdash;a man
of the widest knowledge and most versatile abilities,
distinguished alike as scholar, poet, physician and
naturalist&mdash;who, just two hundred and two years ago,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
published his "Esperienze intorno alla Generazione
degl' Insetti," and gave to the world the idea, the
growth of which it is my purpose to trace. Redi's
book went through five editions in twenty years;
and the extreme simplicity of his experiments, and the
clearness of his arguments, gained for his views and
for their consequences, almost universal acceptance.</p>

<p>Redi did not trouble himself much with speculative
considerations, but attacked particular cases
of what was supposed to be "spontaneous generation"
experimentally. Here are dead animals, or
pieces of meat, says he; I expose them to the air in
hot weather, and in a few days they swarm with
maggots. You tell me that these are generated
in the dead flesh; but if I put similar bodies, while
quite fresh, into a jar, and tie some fine gauze over
the top of the jar, not a maggot makes its appearance,
while the dead substances, nevertheless, putrefy just
in the same way as before. It is obvious, therefore,
that the maggots are not generated by the corruption
of the meat; and that the cause of their formation
must be a something which is kept away by gauze.
But gauze will not keep away ariform bodies, or
fluids. This something must therefore, exist
in the form of solid particles too big to get
through the gauze. Nor is one long left in doubt
what these solid particles are; for the blow-flies,
attracted by the odour of the meat, swarm round the
vessel, and, urged by a powerful but in this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
misleading instinct, lay eggs out of which maggots
are immediately hatched, upon the gauze. The
conclusion, therefore, is unavoidable; the maggots
are not generated by the meat, but the eggs which
give rise to them are brought through the air by the
flies.</p>

<p>These experiments seem almost childishly simple,
and one wonders how it was that no one ever thought
of them before. Simple as they are, however, they are
worthy of the most careful study, for every piece of experimental
work since done, in regard to this subject,
has been shaped upon the model furnished by the
Italian philosopher. As the results of his experiments
were the same, however varied the nature of
the materials he used, it is not wonderful that there
arose in Redi's mind a presumption that, in all such
cases of the seeming production of life from dead
matter, the real explanation was the introduction
of living germs from without into that dead matter.
And thus the hypothesis that living matter always
arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter,
took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right
to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each
particular case, before the production of living
matter in any other way could be admitted by careful
reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to
this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution,
I shall call it the hypothesis of <i>Biogenesis</i>;
and I shall term the contrary doctrine&mdash;that living
matter may be produced by not living matter&mdash;the
hypothesis of <i>Abiogenesis</i>.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century, as I have said, the
latter was the dominant view, sanctioned alike by
antiquity and by authority; and it is interesting to
observe that Redi did not escape the customary tax
upon a discoverer of having to defend himself against
the charge of impugning the authority of the Scriptures;
for his adversaries declared that the generation
of bees from the carcase of a dead lion is affirmed,
in the Book of Judges, to have been the origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXX" id="Num_CCXX">CCXX</a></p>

<p>It remains yet in the order of logic, though not of
history, to show that among these solid destructible
particles there really do exist germs capable of
giving rise to the development of living forms in
suitable menstrua. This piece of work was done by
M. Pasteur in those beautiful researches which will
ever render his name famous; and which, in spite of
all attacks upon them, appear to me now, as they
did seven years ago, to be models of accurate
experimentation and logical reasoning. He strained
air through cotton-wool, and found, as Schroeder
and Dusch had done, that it contained nothing competent
to give rise to the development of life in
fluids highly fitted for that purpose. But the
important further links in the chain of evidence
added by Pasteur are three. In the first place he
subjected to microscopic examination the cotton-wool
which had served as strainer, and found that
sundry bodies clearly recognisable as germs were
among the solid particles strained off. Secondly,
he proved that these germs were competent to give
rise to living forms by simply sowing them in a
solution fitted for their development. And, thirdly,
he showed that the incapacity of air strained through
cotton-wool to give rise to life was not due to any
occult change effected in the constituents of the air by
the wool, by proving that the cotton-wool might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
dispensed with altogether, and perfectly free access
left between the exterior air and that in the experimental
flask. If the neck of the flask is drawn out
into a tube and bent downwards; and if, after
the contained fluid has been carefully boiled, the
tube is heated sufficiently to destroy any germs
which may be present in the air which enters
as the fluid cools, the apparatus may be left to itself
for any time and no life will appear in the fluid.
The reason is plain. Although there is free communication
between the atmosphere laden with
germs and the germless air in the flask, contact
between the two takes place only in the tube; and
as the germs cannot fall upwards, and there are no
currents, they never reach the interior of the flask.
But if the tube be broken short off where it proceeds
from the flask, and free access be thus given to
germs falling vertically out of the air, the fluid,
which has remained clear and desert for months,
becomes, in a few days, turbid and full of life.</p>

<p>In autumn it is not uncommon to see flies
motionless upon a window-pane, with a sort of
magic circle, in white, drawn round them. On
microscopic examination, the magic circle is found
to consist of innumerable spores, which have been
thrown off in all directions by a minute fungus
called <i>Empusa musc&aelig;</i>, the spore-forming filaments
of which stand out like a pile of velvet from the
body of the fly. These spore-forming filaments
are connected with others which fill the interior
of the fly's body like so much fine wool, having
eaten away and destroyed the creature's viscera.
This is the full-grown condition of the <i>Empusa</i>.
If traced back to its earliest stages, in flies which
are still active, and to all appearance healthy, it
is found to exist in the form of minute corpuscles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
which float in the blood of the fly. These multiply
and lengthen into filaments, at the expense of
the fly's substance; and when they have at last
killed the patient, they grow out of its body and
give off spores. Healthy flies shut up with
diseased ones catch this mortal disease, and perish
like the others. A most competent observer, M.
Cohn, who studied the development of the <i>Empusa</i>
very carefully, was utterly unable to discover in
what manner the smallest germs of the <i>Empusa</i>
got into the fly. The spores could not be made
to give rise to such germs by cultivation; nor were
such germs discoverable in the air, or in the food
of the fly. It looked exceedingly like a case of
Abiogenesis, or, at any rate, of Xenogenesis; and
it is only quite recently that the real course of events
has been made out. It has been ascertained that
when one of the spores falls upon the body of a
fly, it begins to germinate, and sends out a process
which bores its way through the fly's skin; this,
having reached the interior cavities of its body,
gives off the minute floating corpuscles which are
the earliest stage of the <i>Empusa</i>. The disease
is "contagious," because a healthy fly coming
in contact with a diseased one, from which the
spore-bearing filaments protrude, is pretty sure
to carry off a spore or two. It is "infectious"
because the spores become scattered about all
sorts of matter in the neighbourhood of the slain flies.</p>

<p>Silkworms are liable to many diseases; and,
even before 1853, a peculiar epizootic, frequently
accompanied by the appearance of dark spots upon
the skin (whence the name of "Pbrine" which
it has received), had been noted for its mortality.
But in the years following 1853 this malady broke
out with such extreme violence, that, in 1858, the
silk-crop was reduced to a third of the amount
which it had reached in 1853; and, up till within
the last year or two, it has never attained half the
yield of 1853. This means not only that the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
number of people engaged in silk growing are
some thirty millions sterling poorer than they might
have been; it means not only that high prices have
had to be paid for imported silkworm eggs, and
that, after investing his money in them, in paying
for mulberry-leaves and for attendance, the cultivator
has constantly seen his silkworms perish and
himself plunged in ruin; but it means that the looms
of Lyons have lacked employment, and that, for
years, enforced idleness and misery have been the
portion of a vast population which, in former days,
was industrious and well-to-do.</p>

<p>In reading the Report made by M. de Quatrefages
in 1859, it is exceedingly interesting to observe that
his elaborate study of the Pbrine forced the conviction
upon his mind that, in its mode of occurrence
and propagation, the disease of the silkworm is, in
every respect, comparable to the cholera among
mankind. But it differs from the cholera, and so
far is a more formidable malady, in being hereditary,
and in being, under some circumstances, contagious
as well as infectious.</p>

<p>The Italian naturalist, Filippi, discovered in the
blood of the silkworms affected by this strange
disorder a multitude of cylindrical corpuscles, each
about 1/6000th of an inch long. These have been
carefully studied by Lebert, and named by him
<i>Panhistophyton</i>; for the reason that in subjects in
which the disease is strongly developed, the corpuscles
swarm in every tissue and organ of the
body, and even pass into the undeveloped eggs of
the female moth. But are these corpuscles causes,
or mere concomitants, of the disease? Some naturalists
took one view and some another; and it was
not until the French Government, alarmed by the
continued ravages of the malady, and the inefficiency
of the remedies which had been suggested, despatched
M. Pasteur to study it, that the question
received its final settlement; at a great sacrifice,
not only of the time and peace of mind of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
eminent philosopher, but, I regret to have to add,
of his health.</p>

<p>But the sacrifice has not been in vain. It is now
certain that this devastating, cholera-like Pbrine
is the effect of the growth and multiplication of
the <i>Panhistophyton</i> in the silkworm. It is contagious
and infectious, because the corpuscles of the <i>Panhistophyton</i>
pass away from the bodies of the diseased
caterpillars, directly or indirectly, to the alimentary
canal of healthy silkworms in their neighbourhood;
it is hereditary because the corpuscles enter into
the eggs while they are being formed, and consequently
are carried within them when they are
laid; and for this reason, also, it presents the very
singular peculiarity of being inherited only on the
mother's side. There is not a single one of all the
apparently capricious and unaccountable phenomena
presented by the Pbrine, but has received its
explanation from the fact that the disease is the
result of the presence of the microscopic organism,
<i>Panhistophyton</i>.</p>

<p>I commenced this Address by asking you to
follow me in an attempt to trace the path which
has been followed by a scientific idea, in its long
and slow progress from the position of a probable
hypothesis to that of an established law of nature.
Our survey has not taken us into very attractive
regions; it has lain, chiefly, in a land flowing with
the abominable, and peopled with mere grubs and
mouldiness. And it may be imagined with what
smiles and shrugs, practical and serious contemporaries
of Redi and of Spallanzani may have commented
on the waste of their high abilities in toiling at the
solution of problems which, though curious enough
in themselves, could be of no conceivable utility to
mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, you will have observed that before
we had travelled very far upon our road, there
appeared, on the right hand and on the left, fields
laden with a harvest of golden grain, immediately
convertible into those things which the most solidly
practical men will admit to have value&mdash;viz., money
and life.</p>

<p>The direct loss to France caused by the Pbrine
in seventeen years cannot be estimated at less than
fifty millions sterling; and if we add to this what
Redi's idea, in Pasteur's hands, has done for the
wine-grower and for the vinegar-maker, and try to
capitalise its value, we shall find that it will go a
long way towards repairing the money losses caused
by the frightful and calamitous war of this autumn
(1870). And as to the equivalent of Redi's thought in
life, how can we overestimate the value of that knowledge
of the nature of epidemic and epizootic diseases,
and consequently of the means of checking, or
eradicating them, the dawn of which has assuredly
commenced?</p>

<p>Looking back no further than ten years, it is
possible to select three (1863, 1864, and 1869) in
which the total number of deaths from scarlet-fever
alone amounted to ninety thousand. That
is the return of killed, the maimed and disabled
being left out of sight. Why, it is to be hoped
that the list of killed in the present bloodiest of
all wars will not amount to more than this! But
the facts which I have placed before you must
leave the least sanguine without a doubt that the
nature and the causes of this scourge will, one day,
be as well understood as those of the Pbrine are
now; and that the long-suffered massacre of our
innocents will come to an end.</p>

<p>And thus mankind will have one more admonition
that "the people perish for lack of knowledge";
and that the alleviation of the miseries,
and the promotion of the welfare, of men must
be sought, by those who will not lose their pains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in that diligent, patient, loving study of all the
multitudinous aspects of Nature, the results of which
constitute exact knowledge, or Science.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXIII" id="Num_CCXXIII">CCXXIII</a></p>

<p>I find three, more or less contradictory, systems
of geological thought, each of which might fairly
enough claim these appellations, standing side by
side in Britain. I shall call one of them Catastrophism,
another Uniformitarianism, the third
Evolutionism; and I shall try briefly to sketch the
characters of each, that you may say whether the
classification is, or is not, exhaustive.</p>

<p>By Catastrophism I mean any form of geological
speculation which, in order to account for the
phenomena of geology, supposes the operation of
forces different in their nature, or immeasurably
different in power, from those which we at present
see in action in the universe.</p>

<p>The Mosaic cosmogony is, in this sense, catastrophic,
because it assumes the operation of extranatural
power. The doctrine of violent upheavals,
<i>dbcles</i>, and cataclysms in general, is catastrophic,
so far as it assumes that these were brought about
by causes which have now no parallel. There was
a time when catastrophism might, pre-eminently,
have claimed the title of "British popular geology";
and assuredly it has yet many adherents, and reckons
among its supporters some of the most honoured
members of this Society.</p>

<p>By Uniformitarianism I mean especially the
teaching of Hutton and of Lyell.</p>

<p>That great though incomplete work, "The
Theory of the Earth," seems to me to be one of the
most remarkable contributions to geology which is
recorded in the annals of the science. So far as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
not-living world is concerned, uniformitarianism lies
there, not only in germ, but in blossom and fruit.</p>

<p>If one asks how it is that Hutton was led to
entertain views so far in advance of those prevalent
in his time, in some respects; while, in others, they
seem almost curiously limited, the answer appears
to me to be plain.</p>

<p>Hutton was in advance of the geological speculation
of his time, because, in the first place, he had
amassed a vast store of knowledge of the facts
of geology, gathered by personal observation in
travels of considerable extent; and because, in the
second place, he was thoroughly trained in the
physical and chemical science of his day, and thus
possessed, as much as any one in his time could
possess it, the knowledge which is requisite for the
just interpretation of geological phenomena, and the
habit of thought which fits a man for scientific
inquiry.</p>

<p>It is to this thorough scientific training that I
ascribe Hutton's steady and persistent refusal to
look to other causes than those now in operation
for the explanation of geological phenomena.</p>

<p>The internal heat of the earth, the elevation and
depression of its crust, its belchings forth of vapours,
ashes, and lava, are its activities, in as strict a sense
as are warmth and the movements and products of
respiration the activities of an animal. The phenomena
of the seasons, of the trade winds, of the Gulf-stream,
are as much the results of the reaction
between these inner activities and outward forces
as are the budding of the leaves in spring and their
falling in autumn the effects of the interaction
between the organisation of a plant and the solar
light and heat. And, as the study of the activities
of the living being is called its physiology, so are
these phenomena the subject-matter of an analogous
telluric physiology, to which we sometimes give the
name of meteorology, sometimes that of physical
geography, sometimes that of geology. Again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
earth has a place in space and in time, and relations
to other bodies in both these respects, which constitute
its distribution. This subject is usually left
to the astronomer; but a knowledge of its broad
outlines seems to me to be an essential constituent of
the stock of geological ideas.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXIV" id="Num_CCXXIV">CCXXIV</a></p>

<p>All that can be ascertained concerning the
structure, succession of conditions, actions, and
position in space of the earth, is the matter of fact
of its natural history. But, as in biology, there
remains the matter of reasoning from these facts to
their causes, which is just as much science as the
other, and indeed more; and this constitutes geological
&aelig;tiology.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXV" id="Num_CCXXV">CCXXV</a></p>

<p>I suppose that it would be very easy to pick holes
in the details of Kant's speculations, whether cosmological,
or specially telluric, in their application.
But for all that, he seems to me to have been the
first person to frame a complete system of geological
speculation by founding the doctrine of evolution.</p>

<p>I have said that the three schools of geological
speculation which I have termed Catastrophism,
Uniformitarianism, and Evolutionism, are commonly
supposed to be antagonistic to one another; and I
presume it will have become obvious that in my
belief, the last is destined to swallow up the other
two. But it is proper to remark that each of
the latter has kept alive the tradition of precious
truths.</p>

<p>To my mind there appears to be no sort of
necessary theoretical antagonism between Catastrophism
and Uniformitarianism. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
it is very conceivable that catastrophes may be part
and parcel of uniformity. Let me illustrate my
case by analogy. The working of a clock is a
model of uniform action; good time-keeping means
uniformity of action. But the striking of the clock
is essentially a catastrophe; the hammer might be
made to blow up a barrel of gunpowder, or turn on
a deluge of water; and, by proper arrangement,
the clock, instead of marking the hours, might
strike at all sorts of irregular periods, never twice
alike, in the intervals, force, or number of its blows.
Nevertheless, all these irregular, and apparently
lawless, catastrophes would be the result of an
absolutely uniformitarian action; and we might have
two schools of clock-theorists, one studying the
hammer and the other the pendulum.</p>

<p>Mathematics may be compared to a mill of
exquisite workmanship, which grinds your stuff of
any degree of fineness; but, nevertheless, what you
get out depends upon what you put in; and as the
grandest mill in the world will not extract wheat-flour
from peascods, so pages of formul&aelig; will not
get a definite result out of loose data.</p>

<p>The motive of the drama of human life is the necessity,
laid upon every man who comes into the world,
of discovering the mean between self-assertion and
self-restraint suited to his character and his circumstances.
And the eternally tragic aspect of the
drama lies in this: that the problem set before us is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
one the elements of which can be but imperfectly
known, and of which even an approximately right
solution rarely presents itself, until that stern critic,
aged experience, has been furnished with ample
justification for venting his sarcastic humour upon
the irreparable blunders we have already made.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXVIII" id="Num_CCXXVIII">CCXXVIII</a></p>

<p>That which endures is not one or another association
of living forms, but the process of which the
cosmos is the product, and of which these are among
the transitory expressions. And in the living world,
one of the most characteristic features of this cosmic
process is the struggle for existence, the competition
of each with all, the result of which is the selection,
that is to say, the survival of those forms which, on
the whole, are best adapted to the conditions which
at any period obtain; and which are therefore, in
that respect, and only in that respect, the fittest.
The acme reached by the cosmic process in the
vegetation of the downs is seen in the turf, with its
weed and gorse. Under the conditions, they have
come out of the struggle victorious; and, by surviving,
have proved that they are the fittest to survive.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXIX" id="Num_CCXXIX">CCXXIX</a></p>

<p>As a natural process, of the same character as the
development of a tree from its seed, or of a fowl from
its egg, evolution excludes creation and all other
kinds of supernatural intervention. As the expression
of a fixed order, every stage of which is the
effect of causes operating according to definite rules,
the conception of evolution no less excludes that of
chance. It is very desirable to remember that evolution
is not an explanation of the cosmic process, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
merely a generalized statement of the method and
results of that process. And, further, that, if there
is proof that the cosmic process was set going by any
agent, then that agent will be the creator of it and
of all its products, although, supernatural intervention
may remain strictly excluded from its further
course.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXX" id="Num_CCXXX">CCXXX</a></p>

<p>All plants and animals exhibit the tendency to vary,
the causes of which have yet to be ascertained; it
is the tendency of the conditions of life, at any given
time, while favouring the existence of the variations
best adapted to them, to oppose that of the rest and
thus to exercise selection; and all living things tend
to multiply without limit, while the means of support
are limited; the obvious cause of which is the production
of offspring more numerous than their progenitors,
but with equal expectation of life in the
actuarial sense. Without the first tendency there
could be no evolution. Without the second, there
would be no good reason why one variation should
disappear and another take its place; that is to say,
there would be no selection. Without the third, the
struggle for existence, the agent of the selective
process in the state of nature, would vanish.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXI" id="Num_CCXXXI">CCXXXI</a></p>

<p>The faith which is born of knowledge finds its
object in an eternal order, bringing forth ceaseless
change, through endless time, in endless space; the
manifestations of the cosmic energy alternating
between phases of potentiality and phases of explication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXII" id="Num_CCXXXII">CCXXXII</a></p>

<p>With all their enormous differences in natural
endowment, men agree in one thing, and that is their
innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and escape the
pains of life; and, in short, to do nothing but that
which it pleases them to do, without the least reference
to the welfare of the society into which they are
born. That is their inheritance (the reality at the
bottom of the doctrine of original sin) from the long
series of ancestors, human and semi-human and
brutal, in whom the strength of this innate tendency
to self-assertion was the condition of victory in the
struggle for existence. That is the reason of the
<i>aviditas vit&aelig;</i>&mdash;the insatiable hunger for enjoyment&mdash;of
all mankind, which is one of the essential conditions
of success in the war with the state of nature
outside; and yet the sure agent of the destruction of
society if allowed free play within.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXIII" id="Num_CCXXXIII">CCXXXIII</a></p>

<p>The check upon this free play of self-assertion, or
natural liberty, which is the necessary condition for
the origin of human society, is the product of organic
necessities of a different kind from those upon which
the constitution of the hive depends. One of these
is the mutual affection of parent and offspring, intensified
by the long infancy of the human species.
But the most important is the tendency, so strongly
developed in man, to reproduce in himself actions and
feelings similar to, or correlated with, those of other
men. Man is the most consummate of all mimics in
the animal world; none but himself can draw or
model; none comes near him in the scope, variety,
and exactness of vocal imitation; none is such a
master of gesture; while he seems to be impelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
thus to imitate for the pure pleasure of it. And there is
no such another emotional chameleon. By a purely
reflex operation of the mind, we take the hue of
passion of those who are about us, or, it may be, the
complementary colour. It is not by any conscious
"putting one's self in the place" of a joyful or a suffering
person that the state of mind we call sympathy
usually arises; indeed, it is often contrary to one's
sense of right, and in spite of one's will, that "fellow-feeling
makes us wondrous kind," or the reverse.
However complete may be the indifference to public
opinion, in a cool, intellectual view, of the traditional
sage, it has not yet been my fortune to meet with
any actual sage who took its hostile manifestations
with entire equanimity. Indeed, I doubt if the
philosopher lives, or ever has lived, who could know
himself to be heartily despised by a street boy without
some irritation. And, though one cannot justify
Haman for wishing to hang Mordecai on such a very
high gibbet, yet, really, the consciousness of the
Vizier of Ahasuerus, as he went in and out of the
gate, that this obscure Jew had no respect for him,
must have been very annoying.</p>

<p>It is needful only to look around us, to see that
the greatest restrainer of the anti-social tendencies
of men is fear, not of the law, but of the opinion of
their fellows. The conventions of honour bind men
who break legal, moral, and religious bonds; and,
while people endure the extremity of physical pain
rather than part with life, shame drives the weakest
to suicide.</p>

<p>Every forward step of social progress brings men
into closer relations with their fellows, and increases
the importance of the pleasures and pains derived
from sympathy. We judge the acts of others by
our own sympathies, and we judge our own acts
by the sympathies of others, every day and all
day long, from childhood upwards, until associations,
as indissoluble as those of language, are formed
between certain acts and the feelings of approbation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
or disapprobation. It becomes impossible to imagine
some acts without disapprobation, or others without
approbation of the actor, whether he be one's self
or anyone else. We come to think in the acquired
dialect of morals. An artificial personality, the
"man within," as Adam Smith calls conscience,
is built up beside the natural personality. He is the
watchman of society, charged to restrain the anti-social
tendencies of the natural man within the
limits required by social welfare.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXIV" id="Num_CCXXXIV">CCXXXIV</a></p>

<p>I have termed this evolution of the feelings out
of which the primitive bonds of human society are
so largely forged, into the organized and personified
sympathy we call conscience, the ethical process.
So far as it tends to make any human society more
efficient in the struggle for existence with the state
of nature, or with other societies, it works in harmonious
contrast with the cosmic process. But
it is none the less true that, since law and morals
are restraints upon the struggle for existence between
men in society, the ethical process is in opposition
to the principle of the cosmic process, and tends
to the suppression of the qualities best fitted for
success in that struggle.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXV" id="Num_CCXXXV">CCXXXV</a></p>

<p>Moralists of all ages and of all faiths, attending
only to the relations of men towards one another
in an ideal society, have agreed upon the "golden
rule," "Do as you would be done by." In other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
words, let sympathy be your guide; put yourself
in the place of the man towards whom your action
is directed; and do to him what you would like to
have done to yourself under the circumstances.
However much one may admire the generosity of
such a rule of conduct; however confident one may
be that average men may be thoroughly depended
upon not to carry it out to its full logical consequences;
it is nevertheless desirable to recognise
the fact that these consequences are incompatible
with the existence of a civil state, under any circumstances
of this world which have obtained, or,
so far as one can see, are likely to come to
pass.</p>

<p>For I imagine there can be no doubt that the
great desire of every wrongdoer is to escape from
the painful consequences of his actions. If I put
myself in the place of the man who has robbed me,
I find that I am possessed by an exceeding desire
not to be fined or imprisoned; if in that of the
man who has smitten me on one cheek, I contemplate
with satisfaction the absence of any worse
result than the turning of the other cheek for like
treatment. Strictly observed, the "golden rule"
involves the negation of law by the refusal to put it
in motion against law-breakers; and, as regards
the external relations of a polity, it is the refusal
to continue the struggle for existence. It can be
obeyed, even partially, only under the protection of
a society which repudiates it. Without such
shelter the followers of the "golden rule" may
indulge in hopes of heaven, but they must reckon
with the certainty that other people will be masters
of the earth.</p>

<p>In a large proportion of cases, crime and pauperism
have nothing to do with heredity; but are
the consequence, partly, of circumstances and,
partly, of the possession of qualities, which, under
different conditions of life, might have excited
esteem and even admiration. It was a shrewd
man of the world who, in discussing sewage
problems, remarked that dirt is riches in the wrong
place; and that sound aphorism has moral applications.
The benevolence and open-handed generosity
which adorn a rich man may make a pauper
of a poor one; the energy and courage to which
the successful soldier owes his rise, the cool and
daring subtlety to which the great financier owes
his fortune, may very easily, under unfavourable
conditions, lead their possessors to the gallows,
or to the hulks. Moreover, it is fairly probable
that the children of a "failure" will receive from
their other parent just that little modification of
character which makes all the difference. I sometimes
wonder whether people, who talk so freely
about extirpating the unfit, ever dispassionately
consider their own history. Surely, one must be
very "fit" indeed not to know of an occasion,
or perhaps two, in one's life, when it would have
been only too easy to qualify for a place among
the "unfit."</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXVII" id="Num_CCXXXVII">CCXXXVII</a></p>

<p>In the struggle for the means of enjoyment, the
qualities which ensure success are energy, industry,
intellectual capacity, tenacity of purpose, and, at
least as much sympathy as is necessary to make a
man understand the feelings of his fellows. Were
there none of those artificial arrangements by which
fools and knaves are kept at the top of society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
instead of sinking to their natural place at the bottom,
the struggle for the means of enjoyment would
ensure a constant circulation of the human units of
the social compound, from the bottom to the top and
from the top to the bottom. The survivors of the
contest, those who continued to form the great bulk
of the polity, would not be those "fittest" who got
to the very top, but the great body of the moderately
"fit," whose numbers and superior propagative
power enable them always to swamp the exceptionally
endowed minority.</p>

<p>I think it must be obvious to every one that,
whether we consider the internal or the external
interests of society, it is desirable they should be in
the hands of those who are endowed with the
largest share of energy, of industry, of intellectual
capacity, of tenacity of purpose, while they are not
devoid of sympathetic humanity; and, in so far as
the struggle for the means of enjoyment tends to
place such men in possession of wealth and influence,
it is a process which tends to the good of
society. But the process, as we have seen, has
no real resemblance to that which adapts living
beings to current conditions in the state of nature;
nor any to the artificial selection of the horticulturist.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXXXVIII" id="Num_CCXXXVIII">CCXXXVIII</a></p>

<p>Even should the whole human race be absorbed in
one vast polity, within which "absolute political justice"
reigns, the struggle for existence with the state
of nature outside it, and the tendency to the return of the
struggle within, in consequence of over-multiplication,
will remain; and, unless men's inheritance from the
ancestors who fought a good fight in the state of
nature, their dose of original sin, is rooted out by
some method at present unrevealed, at any rate to
disbelievers in supernaturalism, every child born into
the world will still bring with him the instinct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
unlimited self-assertion. He will have to learn the
lesson of self-restraint and renunciation. But the
practice of self-restraint and renunciation is not
happiness, though it may be something much
better.</p>

<p>That man, as a "political animal," is susceptible of
a vast amount of improvement, by education, by
instruction, and by the application of his intelligence
to the adaptation of the conditions of life to his
higher needs, I entertain not the slightest doubt.
But, so long as he remains liable to error, intellectual
or moral; so long as he is compelled to be
perpetually on guard against the cosmic forces,
whose ends are not his ends, without and within
himself; so long as he is haunted by inexpugnable
memories and hopeless aspirations; so long as the
recognition of his intellectual limitations forces him
to acknowledge his incapacity to penetrate the
mystery of existence; the prospect of attaining
untroubled happiness, or of a state which can, even
remotely, deserve the title of perfection, appears to
me to be as misleading an illusion as ever was
dangled before the eyes of poor humanity. And
there have been many of them.</p>

<p>That which lies before the human race is a constant
struggle to maintain and improve, in opposition
to the State of Nature, the State of Art of an
organized polity; in which, and by which, man
may develop a worthy civilization, capable of maintaining
and constantly improving itself, until the
evolution of our globe shall have entered so far upon
its downward course that the cosmic process resumes
its sway; and, once more, the State of Nature
prevails over the surface of our planet.</p>

<p>From very low forms up to the highest&mdash;in the
animal no less than in the vegetable kingdom&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
process of life presents the same appearance of
cyclical evolution. Nay, we have but to cast our
eyes over the rest of the world and cyclical change
presents itself on all sides. It meets us in the water
that flows to the sea and returns to the springs; in
the heavenly bodies that wax and wane, go and
return to their places; in the inexorable sequence of
the ages of man's life; in that successive rise,
apogee, and fall of dynasties and of states which
is the most prominent topic of civil history.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXL" id="Num_CCXL">CCXL</a></p>

<p>As no man fording a swift stream can dip his foot
twice into the same water, so no man can, with
exactness, affirm of anything in the sensible world
that it is. As he utters the words, nay, as he thinks
them, the predicate ceases to be applicable; the
present has become the past; the "is" should be
"was." And the more we learn of the nature of
things, the more evident is it that what we call rest
is only unperceived activity; that seeming peace is
silent but strenuous battle. In every part, at every
moment, the state of the cosmos is the expression of
a transitory adjustment of contending forces; a
scene of strife, in which all the combatants fall in
turn. What is true of each part is true of the
whole. Natural knowledge tends more and more to
the conclusion that "all the choir of heaven and
furniture of the earth" are the transitory forms of
parcels of cosmic substance wending along the road of
evolution, from nebulous potentiality, through endless
growths of sun and planet and satellite;
through all varieties of matter; through infinite
diversities of life and thought; possibly, through
modes of being of which we neither have a conception,
nor are competent to form any, back to the
indefinable latency from which they arose. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the most obvious attribute of the cosmos is its
impermanence. It assumes the aspect not so much
of a permanent entity as of a changeful process, in
which naught endures save the flow of energy and
the rational order which pervades it.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLI" id="Num_CCXLI">CCXLI</a></p>

<p>Man, the animal, in fact, has worked his way to
the headship of the sentient world, and has become
the superb animal which he is in virtue of his
success in the struggle for existence. The conditions
having been of a certain order, man's organization
has adjusted itself to them better than that of his
competitors in the cosmic strife. In the case of
mankind, the self-assertion, the unscrupulous seizing
upon all that can be grasped, the tenacious holding
of all that can be kept, which constitute the essence
of the struggle for existence, have answered. For
his successful progress, throughout the savage state,
man has been largely indebted to those qualities
which he shares with the ape and the tiger; his
exceptional physical organization; his cunning, his
sociability, his curiosity, and his imitativeness;
his ruthless and ferocious destructiveness when
his anger is roused by opposition.</p>

<p>But, in proportion as men have passed from
anarchy to social organization, and in proportion
as civilization has grown in worth, these deeply
ingrained serviceable qualities have become defects.
After the manner of successful persons, civilized
man would gladly kick down the ladder by which
he has climbed. He would be only too pleased to
see "the ape and tiger die." But they decline to
suit his convenience; and the unwelcome intrusion
of these boon companions of his hot youth into the
ranged existence of civil life adds pains and griefs,
innumerable and immeasurably great, to those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the cosmic process necessarily brings on the mere
animal. In fact, civilized man brands all these ape
and tiger promptings with the name of sins; he
punishes many of the acts which flow from them as
crimes; and, in extreme cases, he does his best to
put an end to the survival of the fittest of former
days by axe and rope.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLII" id="Num_CCXLII">CCXLII</a></p>

<p>In Hindostan, as in Ionia, a period of relatively
high and tolerably stable civilization had succeeded
long ages of semi-barbarism and struggle. Out of
wealth and security had come leisure and refinement,
and, close at their heels, had followed the malady of
thought. To the struggle for bare existence, which
never ends, though it may be alleviated and partially
disguised for a fortunate few, succeeded the struggle
to make existence intelligible and to bring the order
of things into harmony with the moral sense of man,
which also never ends, but, for the thinking few,
becomes keener with every increase of knowledge
and with every step towards the realization of a
worthy ideal of life.</p>

<p>Two thousand five hundred years ago the value
of civilization was as apparent as it is now; then,
as now, it was obvious that only in the garden of an
orderly polity can the finest fruits humanity is
capable of bearing be produced. But it had also
become evident that the blessings of culture were
not unmixed. The garden was apt to turn into
a hothouse. The stimulation of the senses, the
pampering of the emotions, endlessly multiplied the
sources of pleasure. The constant widening of
the intellectual field indefinitely extended the range
of that especially human faculty of looking before
and after, which adds to the fleeting present those
old and new worlds of the past and the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
wherein men dwell the more the higher their culture.
But that very sharpening of the sense and that
subtle refinement of emotion, which brought such a
wealth of pleasures, were fatally attended by a
proportional enlargement of the capacity for suffering;
and the divine faculty of imagination, while
it created new heavens and new earths, provided
them with the corresponding hells of futile regret
for the past and morbid anxiety for the future.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLIII" id="Num_CCXLIII">CCXLIII</a></p>

<p>One of the oldest and most important elements
in such systems is the conception of justice. Society
is impossible unless those who are associated agree
to observe certain rules of conduct towards one
another; its stability depends on the steadiness
with which they abide by that agreement; and, so
far as they waver, that mutual trust which is the
bond of society is weakened or destroyed. Wolves
could not hunt in packs except for the real, though
unexpressed, understanding that they should not
attack one another during the chase. The most
rudimentary polity is a pack of men living under the
like tacit, or expressed, understanding; and having
made the very important advance upon wolf society,
that they agree to use the force of the whole body
against individuals who violate it and in favour of
those who observe it. This observance of a common
understanding, with the consequent distribution of
punishments and rewards according to accepted
rules, received the name of justice, while the contrary
was called injustice. Early ethics did not take
much note of the animus of the violator of the rules.
But civilization could not advance far without the
establishment of a capital distinction between the
case of involuntary and that of wilful misdeed;
between a merely wrong action and a guilty one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>And, with increasing refinement of moral appreciation,
the problem of desert, which arises out of this
distinction, acquired more and more theoretical and
practical importance. If life must be given for life,
yet it was recognized that the unintentional slayer
did not altogether deserve death; and, by a sort of
compromise between the public and the private
conception of justice, a sanctuary was provided in
which he might take refuge from the avenger of
blood.</p>

<p>The idea of justice thus underwent a gradual
sublimation from punishment and reward according
to acts, to punishment and reward according to
desert; or, in other words, according to motive.
Righteousness, that is, action from right motive,
not only became synonymous with justice, but the
positive constituent of innocence and the very heart
of goodness.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLIV" id="Num_CCXLIV">CCXLIV</a></p>

<p>Everyday experience familiarizes us with the facts
which are grouped under the name of heredity.
Every one of us bears upon him obvious marks of his
parentage, perhaps of remoter relationships. More
particularly, the sum of tendencies to act in a certain
way, which we call "character," is often to be
traced through a long series of progenitors and
collaterals. So we may justly say that this
"character"&mdash;this moral and intellectual essence of a
man&mdash;does veritably pass over from one fleshy tabernacle
to another, and does really transmigrate from
generation to generation. In the new-born infant
the character of the stock lies latent, and the Ego is
little more than a bundle of potentialities. But, very
early, these become actualities; from childhood to age
they manifest themselves in dullness or brightness,
weakness or strength, viciousness or uprightness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and with each feature modified by confluence with
another character, if by nothing else, the character
passes on to its incarnation in new bodies.</p>

<p>Only one rule of conduct could be based upon the
remarkable theory of which I have endeavoured to
give a reasoned outline. It was folly to continue to
exist when an overplus of pain was certain; and the
probabilities in favour of the increase of misery with
the prolongation of existence, were so overwhelming.
Slaying the body only made matters worse; there
was nothing for it but to slay the soul by the voluntary
arrest of all its activities. Property, social ties,
family affections, common companionship, must be
abandoned; the most natural appetites, even that for
food, must be suppressed, or at least minimized;
until all that remained of a man was the impassive,
extenuated, mendicant monk, self-hypnotised into
cataleptic trances, which the deluded mystic took for
foretastes of the final union with Brahma.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLVI" id="Num_CCXLVI">CCXLVI</a></p>

<p>If the cosmos is the effect of an immanent,
omnipotent, and infinitely beneficent cause, the existence
in it of real evil, still less of necessarily
inherent evil, is plainly inadmissible. Yet the
universal experience of mankind testified then, as
now, that, whether we look within us or without us,
evil stares us in the face on all sides; that if anything
is real, pain and sorrow and wrong are realities.</p>

<p>It would be a new thing in history if <i>a priori</i> philosophers
were daunted by the factious opposition of
experience; and the Stoics were the last men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
allow themselves to be beaten by mere facts. "Give
me a doctrine and I will find the reasons for it," said
Chrysippus. So they perfected, if they did not invent,
that ingenious and plausible form of pleading, the
Theodicy; for the purpose of showing firstly, that
there is no such thing as evil; secondly, that if there
is, it is the necessary correlate of good; and, moreover,
that it is either due to our own fault, or inflicted
for our benefit.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLVII" id="Num_CCXLVII">CCXLVII</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is much easier to shut one's eyes
to good than to evil. Pain and sorrow knock at our
doors more loudly than pleasure and happiness; and
the prints of their heavy footsteps are less easily
effaced.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLVIII" id="Num_CCXLVIII">CCXLVIII</a></p>

<p>In the language of the Stoa, "Nature" was a word
of many meanings. There was the "Nature" of the
cosmos, and the "Nature" of man. In the latter, the
animal "nature," which man shares with a moiety of
the living part of the cosmos, was distinguished from
a higher "nature." Even in this higher nature there
were grades of rank. The logical faculty is an
instrument which may be turned to account for any
purpose. The passions and the emotions are so
closely tied to the lower nature that they may be
considered to be pathological, rather than normal,
phenomena. The one supreme, hegemonic, faculty,
which constitutes the essential "nature" of man, is
most nearly represented by that which, in the
language of a later philosophy, has been called the
pure reason. It is this "nature" which holds up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
ideal of the supreme good and demands absolute submission
of the will to its behests. It is this which
commands all men to love one another, to return good
for evil, to regard one another as fellow-citizens of
one great state. Indeed, seeing that the progress
towards perfection of a civilised state, or polity,
depends on the obedience of its members to these
commands, the Stoics sometimes termed the pure
reason the "political" nature. Unfortunately, the
sense of the adjective has undergone so much modification
that the application of it to that which commands
the sacrifice of self to the common good would
now sound almost grotesque.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXLIX" id="Num_CCXLIX">CCXLIX</a></p>

<p>The majority of us, I apprehend, profess neither
pessimism nor optimism. We hold that the world
is neither so good, nor so bad, as it conceivably
might be; and, as most of us have reason, now and
again, to discover that it can be. Those who have
failed to experience the joys that make life worth
living are, probably, in as small a minority as those
who have never known the griefs that rob existence
of its savour and turn its richest fruits into mere
dust and ashes.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCL" id="Num_CCL">CCL</a></p>

<p>There is another fallacy which appears to me to
pervade the so-called "ethics of evolution." It is
the notion that because, on the whole, animals and
plants have advanced in perfection of organization by
means of the struggle for existence and the consequent
"survival of the fittest"; therefore men in
society, men as ethical beings, must look to the same
process to help them towards perfection. I suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
that this fallacy has arisen out of the unfortunate
ambiguity of the phrase "survival of the fittest."
"Fittest" has a connotation of "best"; and about
"best" there hangs a moral flavour. In cosmic
nature, however, what is "fittest" depends upon the
conditions. Long since, I ventured to point out that
if our hemisphere were to cool again, the survival of
the fittest might bring about, in the vegetable kingdom,
a population of more and more stunted and
humbler and humbler organisms, until the "fittest"
that survived might be nothing but lichens, diatoms,
and such microscopic organisms as those which give
red snow its colour; while, if it became hotter, the
pleasant valleys of the Thames and Isis might be
uninhabitable by any animated beings save those
that flourish in a tropical jungle. They, as the fittest,
the best adapted to the changed conditions, would
survive.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLI" id="Num_CCLI">CCLI</a></p>

<p>The practice of that which is ethically best&mdash;what
we call goodness or virtue&mdash;involves a course of
conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that
which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for
existence. In place of ruthless self-assertion it
demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside,
or treading down, all competitors, it requires that
the individual shall not merely respect, but shall
help his fellows; its influence is directed, not so
much to the survival of the fittest, as to the fitting
of as many as possible to survive. It repudiates
the gladiatorial theory of existence. It demands
that each man who enters into the enjoyment of the
advantages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt
to those who have laboriously constructed it; and
shall take heed that no act of his weakens the fabric
in which he has been permitted to live. Laws and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
moral precepts are directed to the end of curbing the
cosmic process and reminding the individual of his
duty to the community, to the protection and
influence of which he owes, if not existence itself,
at least the life of something better than a brutal
savage.</p>

<p>The theory of evolution encourages no millennial
anticipations. If, for millions of years, our globe
has taken the upward road, yet, some time, the
summit will be reached and the downward route
will be commenced. The most daring imagination
will hardly venture upon the suggestion that the
power and the intelligence of man can ever arrest
the procession of the great year.</p>

<p>Moreover, the cosmic nature born with us and,
to a large extent, necessary for our maintenance,
is the outcome of millions of years of severe training,
and it would be folly to imagine that a few
centuries will suffice to subdue its masterfulness
to purely ethical ends. Ethical nature may count
upon having to reckon with a tenacious and powerful
enemy as long as the world lasts. But, on the
other hand, I see no limit to the extent to which
intelligence and will, guided by sound principles
of investigation, and organized in common effort,
may modify the conditions of existence, for a period
longer than that now covered by history. And
much may be done to change the nature of man
himself. The intelligence which has converted the
brother of the wolf into the faithful guardian of
the flock ought to be able to do something towards
curbing the instincts of savagery in civilized
men.</p>

<p>But if we may permit ourselves a larger hope of
abatement of the essential evil of the world than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
was possible to those who, in the infancy of exact
knowledge, faced the problem of existence more
than a score of centuries ago, I deem it an essential
condition of the realization of that hope that
we should cast aside the notion that the escape
from pain and sorrow is the proper object of life.</p>

physical science may and probably will, some day,
enable our posterity to set forth the exact physical
concomitants and conditions of the strange rapture
of beauty. But if ever that day arrives, the rapture
will remain, just as it is now, outside and beyond
the physical world; and, even in the mental world,
something superadded to mere sensation. I do
not wish to crow unduly over my humble cousin
the orang, but in the &aelig;sthetic province, as in
that of the intellect, I am afraid he is nowhere.
I doubt not he would detect a fruit amidst a wilderness
of leaves where I could see nothing; but I
am tolerably confident that he has never been
awestruck, as I have been, by the dim religious
gloom, as of a temple devoted to the earthgods,
of the tropical forests which he inhabits. Yet
I doubt not that our poor long-armed and short-legged
friend, as he sits meditatively munching
his durian fruit, has something behind that sad
Socratic face of his which is utterly "beyond the
bounds of physical science." Physical science may
know all about his clutching the fruit and munching
it and digesting it, and how the physical titillation
of his palate is transmitted to some microscopic
cells of the gray matter of his brain. But the
feelings of sweetness and of satisfaction which,
for a moment, hang out their signal lights in his
melancholy eyes, are as utterly outside the bounds
of physics as is the "fine frenzy" of a human
rhapsodist.</p>

<p>When I was a mere boy, with a perverse
tendency to think when I ought to have been
playing, my mind was greatly exercised by this
formidable problem, What would become of things
if they lost their qualities? As the qualities had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
no objective existence, and the thing without
qualities was nothing, the solid world seemed
whittled away&mdash;to my great horror. As I grew
older, and learned to use the terms "matter" and
"force," the boyish problem was revived, <i>mutato
nomine</i>. On the one hand, the notion of matter
without force seemed to resolve the world into a
set of geometrical ghosts, too dead even to jabber.
On the other hand, Boscovich's hypothesis, by
which matter was resolved into centres of force,
was very attractive. But when one tried to think
it out, what in the world became of force considered
as an objective entity? Force, even the
most materialistic of philosophers will agree with
the most idealistic, is nothing but a name for the
cause of motion. And if, with Boscovich, I resolved
things into centres of force, then matter vanished
altogether and left immaterial entities in its place.
One might as well frankly accept Idealism and have
done with it.</p>

The world regards such a person as the police do
an unmuzzled dog, not under proper control. I
could find no label that would suit me, so, in my
desire to range myself and be respectable, I invented
one; and, as the chief thing I was sure of
was that I did not know a great many things that
the-ists and the-ites about me professed to be
familiar with, I called myself an Agnostic. Surely
no denomination could be more modest or more
appropriate; and I cannot imagine why I should
be every now and then haled out of my refuge
and declared sometimes to be a Materialist, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
an Atheist, sometimes a Positivist, and
sometimes, alas and alack, a cowardly or reactionary
Obscurantist.</p>

<p>Lastly, with respect to the old riddle of the freedom
of the will. In the only sense in which the
word freedom is intelligible to me&mdash;that is to say,
the absence of any restraint upon doing what one
likes within certain limits&mdash;physical science certainly
gives no more ground for doubting it than the
common sense of mankind does. And if physical
science, in strengthening our belief in the universality
of causation and abolishing chance as an absurdity,
leads to the conclusion of determinism, it does no
more than follow the track of consistent and logical
thinkers in philosophy and in theology, before it
existed or was thought of. Whoever accepts the
universality of the law of causation as a dogma of
philosophy, denies the existence of uncaused phenomena.
And the essence of that which is improperly
called the freewill doctrine is that occasionally, at
any rate, human volition is self-caused, that is to say,
not caused at all; for to cause oneself one must
have anteceded oneself&mdash;which is, to say the least of
it, difficult to imagine.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLVIII" id="Num_CCLVIII">CCLVIII</a></p>

<p>If the diseases of society consist in the weakness
of its faith in the existence of the God of the
theologians, in a future state, and in uncaused
volitions, the indication, as the doctors say, is
to suppress Theology and Philosophy, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
bickerings about things of which they know
nothing have been the prime cause and continual
sustenance of that evil scepticism which is the
Nemesis of meddling with the unknowable.</p>

<p>Cinderella is modestly conscious of her ignorance
of these high matters. She lights the fire, sweeps
the house, and provides the dinner; and is rewarded
by being told that she is a base creature, devoted to
low and material interests. But in her garret she has
fairy visions out of the ken of the pair of shrews
who are quarrelling downstairs. She sees the order
which pervades the seeming disorder of the world;
the great drama of evolution, with its full share of
pity and terror, but also with abundant goodness
and beauty, unrolls itself before her eyes; and she
learns, in her heart of hearts, the lesson, that the
foundation of morality is to have done, once and for
all, with lying; to give up pretending to believe that
for which there is no evidence, and repeating unintelligible
propositions about things beyond the
possibilities of knowledge.</p>

<p>She knows that the safety of morality lies neither
in the adoption of this or that philosophical speculation,
or this or that theological creed, but in a real
and living belief in that fixed order of nature which
sends social disorganisation upon the track of
immorality, as surely as it sends physical disease
after physical trespasses. And of that firm and
lively faith it is her high mission to be the
priestess.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLIX" id="Num_CCLIX">CCLIX</a></p>

<p>The first act of a new-born child is to draw a deep
breath. In fact, it will never draw a deeper, inasmuch
as the passages and chambers of the lungs,
once distended with air, do not empty themselves
again; it is only a fraction of their contents which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
passes in and out with the flow and the ebb of the
respiratory tide. Mechanically, this act of drawing
breath, or inspiration, is of the same nature as that
by which the handles of a bellows are separated,
in order to fill the bellows with air; and, in like
manner, it involves that expenditure of energy
which we call exertion, or work, or labour. It is,
therefore, no mere metaphor to say that man is
destined to a life of toil: the work of respiration
which began with his first breath ends only with his
last; nor does one born in the purple get off with a
lighter task than the child who first sees light under
a hedge.</p>

<p>How is it that the new-born infant is enabled to
perform this first instalment of the sentence of life-long
labour which no man may escape? Whatever
else a child may be, in respect of this particular
question, it is a complicated piece of mechanism,
built up out of materials supplied by its mother; and
in the course of such building-up, provided with a set
of motors&mdash;the muscles. Each of these muscles
contains a stock of substance capable of yielding
energy under certain conditions, one of which is a
change of state in the nerve-fibres connected with it.
The powder in a loaded gun is such another stock of
substance capable of yielding energy in consequence
of a change of state in the mechanism of the lock,
which intervenes between the finger of the man who
pulls the trigger and the cartridge. If that change
is brought about, the potential energy of the powder
passes suddenly into actual energy, and does the
work of propelling the bullet. The powder, therefore,
may be appropriately called <i>work-stuff</i>, not only
because it is stuff which is easily made to yield work
in the physical sense, but because a good deal of
work in the economical sense has contributed to its
production. Labour was necessary to collect,
transport, and purify the raw sulphur and saltpetre;
to cut wood and convert it into powdered charcoal;
to mix these ingredients in the right proportions; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
give the mixture the proper grain, and so on. The
powder once formed part of the stock, or capital, of
a powder-maker: and it is not only certain natural
bodies which are collected and stored in the gunpowder,
but the labour bestowed on the operations
mentioned may be figuratively said to be incorporated
in it.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLX" id="Num_CCLX">CCLX</a></p>

<p>In principle, the work-stuff stored in the muscles
of the new-born child is comparable to that stored
in the gun-barrel. The infant is launched into
altogether new surroundings; and these operate
through the mechanism of the nervous machinery,
with the result that the potential energy of some
of the work-stuff in the muscles which bring about
inspiration is suddenly converted into actual energy;
and this, operating through the mechanism of the
respiratory apparatus, gives rise to an act of inspiration.
As the bullet is propelled by the "going off"
of the powder, as it might be said that the ribs are
raised and the midriff depressed by the "going off"
of certain portions of muscular work-stuff. This
work-stuff is part of a stock or capital of that
commodity stored up in the child's organism
before birth, at the expense of the mother; and the
mother has made good her expenditure by drawing
upon the capital of food-stuffs which furnished her
daily maintenance.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it does not appear to
me to be open to doubt that the primary act of
outward labour in the series which necessarily
accompany the life of man is dependent upon the
pre-existence of a stock of material which is not
only of use to him, but which is disposed in such a
manner as to be utilisable with facility. And I
further imagine that the propriety of the application
of the term "capital" to this stock of useful substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
cannot be justly called in question; inasmuch
as it is easy to prove that the essential constituents
of the work-stuff accumulated in the child's
muscles have merely been transferred from the store
of food-stuffs, which everybody admits to be capital,
by means of the maternal organism to that of the
child, in which they are again deposited to await
use. Every subsequent act of labour, in like manner,
involves an equivalent consumption of the child's
store of work-stuff&mdash;its vital capital; and one of the
main objects of the process of breathing is to get rid
of some of the effects of that consumption. It follows,
then, that, even if no other than the respiratory
work were going on in the organism, the capital of
work-stuff, which the child brought with it into the
world, must sooner or later be used up, and the
movements of breathing must come to an end;
just as the see-saw of the piston of a steam-engine
stops when the coal in the fireplace has burnt away.</p>

<p>Milk, however, is a stock of materials which
essentially consists of savings from the food-stuffs
supplied to the mother. And these savings are in
such a physical and chemical condition that the
organism of the child can easily convert them into
work-stuff. That is to say, by borrowing directly
from the vital capital of the mother, indirectly from
the store in the natural bodies accessible to her, it
can make good the loss of its own. The operation
of borrowing, however, involves further work;
that is, the labour of sucking, which is a mechanical
operation of much the same nature as breathing.
The child thus pays for the capital it borrows in
labour; but as the value in work-stuff of the milk
obtained is very far greater than the value of that
labour, estimated by the consumption of work-stuff
it involves, the operation yields a large profit to the
infant. The overplus of food-stuff suffices to
increase the child's capital of work-stuff; and to
supply not only the materials for the enlargement of
the "buildings and machinery" which is expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
by the child's growth, but also the energy required
to put all these materials together, and to carry them
to their proper places. Thus, throughout the years
of infancy, and so long thereafter as the youth or
man is not thrown upon his own resources, he lives
by consuming the vital capital provided by others.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXI" id="Num_CCLXI">CCLXI</a></p>

<p>Let us now suppose the child come to man's estate
in the condition of a wandering savage, dependent
for his food upon what he can pick up or catch, after
the fashion of the Australian aborigines. It is plain
that the place of mother, as the supplier of vital
capital, is now taken by the fruits, seeds, and roots
of plants and by various kinds of animals....
The savage, like the child, borrows the capital he
needs, and, at any rate, intentionally, does nothing
towards repayment; it would plainly be an improper
use of the word "produce" to say that his labour
in hunting for the roots, or the fruits, or the eggs,
or the grubs and snakes, which he finds and eats,
"produces" or contributes to "produce" them.
The same thing is true of more advanced tribes,
who are still merely hunters, such as the Esquimaux.
They may expend more labour and skill; but it is
spent in destruction.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXII" id="Num_CCLXII">CCLXII</a></p>

<p>When we find set forth as an "absolute" truth
the statement that the essential factors in economic
production are land, capital and labour&mdash;when this
is offered as an axiom whence all sorts of other
important truths may be deduced&mdash;it is needful
to remember that the assertion is true only with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a qualification. Undoubtedly "vital capital" is
essential; for, as we have seen, no human work
can be done unless it exists, not even that internal
work of the body which is necessary to passive
life. But, with respect to labour (that is, human
labour) I hope to have left no doubt on the reader's
mind that, in regard to production, the importance
of human labour may be so small as to be almost a
vanishing quantity.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXIII" id="Num_CCLXIII">CCLXIII</a></p>

<p>The one thing needful for economic production
is the green plant, as the sole producer of vital
capital from natural inorganic bodies. Men might
exist without labour (in the ordinary sense) and
without land; without plants they must inevitably
perish.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXIV" id="Num_CCLXIV">CCLXIV</a></p>

<p>Since no amount of labour can produce an ounce
of food-stuff beyond the maximum producible by a
limited number of plants, under the most favourable
circumstances in regard to those conditions which
are not affected by labour, it follows that, if the
number of men to be fed increases indefinitely, a
time must come when some will have to starve.
That is the essence of the so-called Malthusian
doctrine; and it is a truth which, to my mind, is
as plain as the general proposition that a quantity
which constantly increases will, some time or other,
exceed any greater quantity the amount of which
is fixed.</p>

<p>The notion that the value of a thing bears any
necessary relation to the amount of labour (average
or otherwise) bestowed upon it, is a fallacy which
needs no further refutation than it has already
received. The average amount of labour bestowed
upon warming-pans confers no value upon them
in the eyes of a Gold-Coast negro; nor would an
Esquimaux give a slice of blubber for the most
elaborate of ice-machines.</p>

<p>Who has ever imagined that wealth which, in the
hands of an employer, is capital, ceases to be capital
if it is in the hands of a labourer? Suppose a workman
to be paid thirty shillings on Saturday evening
for six days' labour, that thirty shillings comes out
of the employer's capital, and receives the name of
"wages" simply because it is exchanged for labour.
In the workman's pocket, as he goes home, it is a
part of his capital, in exactly the same sense as, half
an hour before, it was part of the employer's capital;
he is a capitalist just as much as if he were a
Rothschild.</p>

<p>I think it may be not too much to say that, of all
the political delusions which are current in this queer
world, the very stupidest are those which assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that labour and capital are necessarily antagonistic;
that all capital is produced by labour and therefore,
by natural right, is the property of the labourer; that
the possessor of capital is a robber who preys on the
workman and appropriates to himself that which he
has had no share in producing.</p>

<p>On the contrary, capital and labour are necessarily,
close allies; capital is never a product of human
labour alone; it exists apart from human labour; it
is the necessary antecedent of labour; and it furnishes
the materials on which labour is employed. The
only indispensable form of capital&mdash;vital capital&mdash;cannot
be produced by human labour. All that man
can do is to favour its formation by the real producers.
There is no intrinsic relation between the amount of
labour bestowed on an article and its value in exchange.
The claim of labour to the total result of
operations which are rendered possible only by capital
is simply an <i>a priori</i> iniquity.</p>

<p>The vast and varied procession of events, which we
call Nature, affords a sublime spectacle and an inexhaustible
wealth of attractive problems to the
speculative observer. If we confine our attention
to that aspect which engages the attention of
the intellect, nature appears a beautiful and
harmonious whole, the incarnation of a faultless
logical process, from certain premisses in the past
to an inevitable conclusion in the future. But if it be
regarded from a less elevated, though more human,
point of view; if our moral sympathies are allowed
to influence our judgment, and we permit ourselves
to criticize our great mother as we criticize one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
another; then our verdict, at least so far as
sentient nature is concerned, can hardly be so
favourable.</p>

<p>In sober truth, to those who have made a study of
the phenomena of life as they are exhibited by the
higher forms of the animal world, the optimistic
dogma, that this is the best of all possible worlds,
will seem little better than a libel upon possibility.
It is really only another instance to be added to the
many extant, of the audacity of <i>a priori</i> speculators
who, having created God in their own image, find
no difficulty in assuming that the Almighty must
have been actuated by the same motives as themselves.
They are quite sure that, had any other
course been practicable, He would no more have
made infinite suffering a necessary ingredient of His
handiwork than a respectable philosopher would have
done the like.</p>

<p>But even the modified optimism of the time-honoured
thesis of physico-theology, that the sentient
world is, on the whole, regulated by principles of
benevolence, does but ill stand the test of impartial
confrontation with the facts of the case. No doubt
it is quite true that sentient nature affords hosts of
examples of subtle contrivances directed towards the
production of pleasure or the avoidance of pain; and
it may be proper to say that these are evidences of
benevolence. But if so, why is it not equally proper
to say of the equally numerous arrangements, the no
less necessary result of which is the production of
pain, that they are evidences of malevolence?</p>

<p>If a vast amount of that which, in a piece of human
workmanship, we should call skill, is visible in those
parts of the organization of a deer to which it owes
its ability to escape from beasts of prey, there is at
least equal skill displayed in that bodily mechanism
of the wolf which enables him to track, and sooner
or later to bring down, the deer. Viewed under the
dry light of science, deer and wolf are alike admirable;
and, if both were non-sentient automata, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
would be nothing to qualify our admiration of the
action of the one on the other. But the fact that the
deer suffers, while the wolf inflicts suffering, engages
our moral sympathies. We should call men like the
deer innocent and good, men such as the wolf
malignant and bad; we should call those who
defended the deer and aided him to escape brave and
compassionate, and those who helped the wolf in his
bloody work base and cruel. Surely, if we transfer
these judgments to nature outside the world of man
at all, we must do so impartially. In that case, the
goodness of the right hand which helps the deer,
and wickedness of the left hand which eggs on the
wolf, will neutralize one another: and the course of
nature will appear to be neither moral nor immoral,
but non-moral.</p>

<p>This conclusion is thrust upon us by analogous
facts in every part of the sentient world; yet, inasmuch
as it not only jars upon prevalent prejudices,
but arouses the natural dislike to that which is
painful, much ingenuity has been exercised in devising
an escape from it.</p>

<p>From the point of view of the moralist the animal
world is on about the same level as a gladiator's
show. The creatures are fairly well treated, and
set to fight&mdash;whereby the strongest, the swiftest,
and the cunningest live to fight another day. The
spectator has no need to turn his thumbs down, as
no quarter is given. He must admit that the skill
and training displayed are wonderful. But he must
shut his eyes if he would not see that more or less
enduring suffering is the meed of both vanquished
and victor. And since the great game is going on
in every corner of the world, thousands of times a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>

by benevolence, it must be a different sort of benevolence
from that of John Howard.</p>

<p>This may not be the best of all possible worlds,
but to say that it is the worst is mere petulant nonsense.
A worn-out voluptuary may find nothing
good under the sun, or a vain and inexperienced youth,
who cannot get the moon he cries for, may vent his
irritation in pessimistic moanings; but there can be
no doubt in the mind of any reasonable person that
mankind could, would, and in fact do, get on fairly
well with vastly less happiness and far more misery
than find their way into the lives of nine people out
of ten. If each and all of us had been visited by an
attack of neuralgia, or of extreme mental depression,
for one hour in every twenty-four&mdash;a supposition
which many tolerably vigorous people know, to their
cost, is not extravagant&mdash;the burden of life would have
been immensely increased without much practical
hindrance to its general course. Men with any
manhood in them find life quite worth living under
worse conditions than these.</p>

<p>There is another sufficiently obvious fact, which
renders the hypothesis that the course of sentient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
nature is dictated by malevolence quite untenable.
A vast multitude of pleasures, and these among the
purest and the best, are superfluities, bits of good
which are to all appearance unnecessary as inducements
to live, and are, so to speak, thrown into the
bargain of life. To those who experience them, few
delights can be more entrancing than such as are
afforded by natural beauty, or by the arts, and
especially by music; but they are products of, rather
than factors in, evolution, and it is probable that
they are known, in any considerable degree, to but
a very small proportion of mankind.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter seems to be
that, if Ormuzd has not had his way in this
world, neither has Ahriman. Pessimism is as little
consonant with the facts of sentient existence as
optimism. If we desire to represent the course of
nature in terms of human thought, and assume that
it was intended to be that which it is, we must say
that its governing principle is intellectual and not
moral; that it is a materialized logical process,
accompanied by pleasures and pains, the incidence
of which, in the majority of cases, has not the
slightest reference to moral desert. That the rain
falls alike upon the just and the unjust, and that
those upon whom the Tower of Siloam fell were no
worse than their neighbours, seem to be Oriental
modes of expressing the same conclusion.</p>

<p>In the strict sense of the word "nature," it denotes
the sum of the phenomenal world, of that which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
been, and is, and will be; and society, like art, is
therefore a part of nature. But it is convenient to
distinguish those parts of nature in which man plays
the part of immediate cause, as something apart;
and therefore, society, like art, is usefully to be
considered as distinct from nature. It is the more
desirable, and even necessary, to make this distinction,
since society differs from nature in having a
definite moral object; whence it comes about that
the course shaped by the ethical man&mdash;the member
of society or citizen&mdash;necessarily runs counter to that
which the non-ethical man&mdash;the primitive savage,
or man as a mere member of the animal kingdom&mdash;tends
to adopt. The latter fights out the struggle
for existence to the bitter end, like any other animal;
the former devotes his best energies to the object of
setting limits to the struggle.</p>

<p>The first men who substituted the state of
mutual peace for that of mutual war, whatever the
motive which impelled them to take that step,
created society. But, in establishing peace, they
obviously put a limit upon the struggle for existence.
Between the members of that society, at any rate,
it was not to be pursued <i> outrance</i>. And of all the
successive shapes which society has taken, that
most nearly approaches perfection in which the war
of individual against individual is most strictly
limited. The primitive savage, tutored by Istar,
appropriated whatever took his fancy, and killed
whosoever opposed him, if he could. On the
contrary, the ideal of the ethical man is to limit his
freedom of action to a sphere in which he does not
interfere with the freedom of others; he seeks the
common weal as much as his own; and, indeed, as
an essential part of his own welfare. Peace is both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
end and means with him; and he founds his life on
a more or less complete self-restraint, which is the
negation of the unlimited struggle for existence.
He tries to escape from his place in the animal
kingdom, founded on the free development of the
principle of non-moral evolution, and to establish a
kingdom of Man, governed upon the principle of
moral evolution. For society not only has a moral
end, but in its perfection, social life, is embodied
morality.</p>

less satisfactory than the position in which we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
ourselves. In a real, though incomplete, degree
we have attained the condition of peace which is
the main object of social organization; and, for
argument's sake, it may be assumed that we desire
nothing but that which is in itself innocent and
praiseworthy&mdash;namely, the enjoyment of the fruits
of honest industry. And lo! in spite of ourselves,
we are in reality engaged in an internecine struggle
for existence with our presumably no less peaceful
and well-meaning neighbours. We seek peace and
we do not ensue it. The moral nature in us asks
for no more than is compatible with the general
good; the non-moral nature proclaims and acts upon
that fine old Scottish family motto, "Thou shalt
starve ere I want." Let us be under no illusions,
then. So long as unlimited multiplication goes on,
no social organization which has ever been devised,
or is likely to be devised, no fiddle-faddling with
the distribution of wealth, will deliver society from
the tendency to be destroyed by the reproduction
within itself, in its intensest form, of that struggle
for existence the limitation of which is the object
of society. And however shocking to the moral
sense this eternal competition of man against man
and of nation against nation may be; however
revolting may be the accumulation of misery at
the negative pole of society, in contrast with that
of monstrous wealth at the positive pole; this state
of things must abide, and grow continually worse,
so long as Istar holds her way unchecked. It is
the true riddle of the Sphinx; and every nation
which does not solve it will sooner or later be
devoured by the monster itself has generated.</p>

<p>It would be folly to entertain any ill-feeling
towards those neighbours and rivals who, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
ourselves, are slaves of Istar; but if somebody is
to be starved, the modern world has no Oracle of
Delphi to which the nations can appeal for an
indication of the victim. It is open to us to try
our fortune; and, if we avoid impending fate,
there will be a certain ground for believing that
we are the right people to escape. <i>Securus judicat
orbis.</i></p>

<p>To this end, it is well to look into the necessary
conditions of our salvation by works. They are
two, one plain to all the world and hardly needing
insistence; the other seemingly not so plain, since
too often it has been theoretically and practically
left out of sight. The obvious condition is that
our produce shall be better than that of others.
There is only one reason why our goods should be
preferred to those of our rivals&mdash;our customers must
find them better at the price. That means that
we must use more knowledge, skill, and industry
in producing them, without a proportionate increase
in the cost of production; and, as the price of
labour constitutes a large element in that cost,
the rate of wages must be restricted within certain
limits. It is perfectly true that cheap production
and cheap labour are by no means synonymous;
but it is also true that wages cannot increase
beyond a certain proportion without destroying
cheapness. Cheapness, then, with, as part and
parcel of cheapness, a moderate price of labour,
is essential to our success as competitors in the
markets of the world.</p>

<p>The second condition is really quite as plainly
indispensable as the first, if one thinks seriously
about the matter. It is social stability. Society
is stable when the wants of its members obtain
as much satisfaction as, life being what it is,
common sense and experience show may be reasonably
expected. Mankind, in general, care very
little for forms of government or ideal considerations
of any sort; and nothing really stirs the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
multitude to break with custom and incur the
manifest perils of revolt except the belief that
misery in this world, or damnation in the next, or
both, are threatened by the continuance of the
state of things in which they have been brought
up. But when they do attain that conviction,
society becomes as unstable as a package of dynamite,
and a very small matter will produce the
explosion which sends it back to the chaos of
savagery.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXX" id="Num_CCLXXX">CCLXXX</a></p>

<p>Intelligence, knowledge, and skill are undoubtedly
conditions of success; but of what avail are they
likely to be unless they are backed up by honesty,
energy, goodwill, and all the physical and moral
faculties that go to the making of manhood, and
unless they are stimulated by hope of such reward
as men may fairly look to? And what dweller in
the slough of want, dwarfed in body and soul,
demoralized, hopeless, can reasonably be expected
to possess these qualities?</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXI" id="Num_CCLXXXI">CCLXXXI</a></p>

<p>I am as strongly convinced as the most pronounced
individualist can be, that it is desirable that every
man should be free to act in every way which does
not limit the corresponding freedom of his fellow-man.
But I fail to connect that great induction of
political science with the practical corollary which is
frequently drawn from it: that the State&mdash;that is,
the people in their corporate capacity&mdash;has no
business to meddle with anything but the administration
of justice and external defence. It appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
me that the amount of freedom which incorporate
society may fitly leave to its members is not a fixed
quantity, to be determined <i>a priori</i> by deduction from
the fiction called "natural rights"; but that it must
be determined by and vary with, circumstances. I
conceive it to be demonstrable that the higher and
the more complex the organization of the social
body, the more closely is the life of each member
bound up with that of the whole; and the larger
becomes the category of acts which cease to be
merely self-regarding, and which interfere with the
freedom of others more or less seriously.</p>

<p>If a squatter, living ten miles away from any
neighbour, chooses to burn his house down to get
rid of vermin, there may be no necessity (in the
absence of insurance offices) that the law should
interfere with his freedom of action; his act can
hurt nobody but himself. But, if the dweller in a
street chooses to do the same thing, the State very
properly makes such a proceeding a crime, and
punishes it as such. He does meddle with his
neighbour's freedom, and that seriously. So it
might, perhaps, be a tenable doctrine, that it would
be needless, and even tyrannous, to make education
compulsory in a sparse agricultural population, living
in abundance on the produce of its own soil; but,
in a densely populated manufacturing country,
struggling for existence with competitors, every
ignorant person tends to become a burden upon, and,
so far, an infringer of the liberty of, his fellows, and
an obstacle to their success. Under such circumstances
an education rate is, in fact, a war tax,
levied for purposes of defence.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXII" id="Num_CCLXXXII">CCLXXXII</a></p>

<p>That State action always has been more or less
misdirected, and always will be so, is, I believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
perfectly true. But I am not aware that it is more
true of the action of men in their corporate capacity
than it is of the doings of individuals. The wisest
and most dispassionate man in existence, merely
wishing to go from one stile in a field to the opposite,
will not walk quite straight&mdash;he is always going a
little wrong, and always correcting himself; and I
can only congratulate the individualist who is able
to say that his general course of life has been of a
less undulatory character. To abolish State action,
because its direction is never more than approximately
correct, appears to me to be much the same
thing as abolishing the man at the wheel altogether,
because, do what he will, the ship yaws more or
less. "Why should I be robbed of my property to
pay for teaching another man's children?" is an
individualist question, which is not unfrequently put
as if it settled the whole business. Perhaps it does,
but I find difficulties in seeing why it should. The
parish in which I live makes me pay my share for
the paving and lighting of a great many streets that
I never pass through; and I might plead that I am
robbed to smooth the way and lighten the darkness
of other people. But I am afraid the parochial
authorities would not let me off on this plea; and I
must confess I do not see why they should.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXIII" id="Num_CCLXXXIII">CCLXXXIII</a></p>

<p>I cannot speak of my own knowledge, but I have
every reason to believe that I came into this world a
small reddish person, certainly without a gold spoon
in my mouth, and in fact with no discernible abstract
or concrete "rights" or property of any description.
If a foot was not set upon me at once, as a squalling
nuisance, it was either the natural affection of those
about me, which I certainly had done nothing to
deserve, or the fear of the law which, ages before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
my birth, was painfully built up by the society into
which I intruded, that prevented that catastrophe.
If I was nourished, cared for, taught, saved from
the vagabondage of a wastrel, I certainly am
not aware that I did anything to deserve those
advantages. And, if I possess anything now, it
strikes me that, though I may have fairly earned
my day's wages for my day's work, and may justly
call them my property&mdash;yet, without that organization
of society, created out of the toil and blood of
long generations before my time, I should probably
have had nothing but a flint axe and an indifferent
hut to call my own; and even those would be mine
only so long as no stronger savage came my way.</p>

<p>So that if society, having, quite gratuitously, done
all these things for me, asks me in turn to do
something towards its preservation&mdash;even if that
something is to contribute to the teaching of other
men's children&mdash;I really, in spite of all my individualist
learnings, feel rather ashamed to say no. And,
if I were not ashamed, I cannot say that I think
that society would be dealing unjustly with me in
converting the moral obligation into a legal one.
There is a manifest unfairness in letting all the
burden be borne by the willing horse.</p>

<p>It is impossible to insist too strongly upon the
fact that efficient teachers of science and of technology
are not to be made by the processes in vogue
at ordinary training colleges. The memory loaded
with mere bookwork is not the thing wanted&mdash;is, in
fact, rather worse than useless&mdash;in the teacher of
scientific subjects. It is absolutely essential that his
mind should be full of knowledge and not of mere
learning, and that what he knows should have
been learned in the laboratory rather than in the
library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>The attempt to form a just conception of the value
of work done in any department of human knowledge,
and of its significance as an indication of the intellectual
and moral qualities of which it was the product,
is an undertaking which must always be beset
with difficulties, and may easily end in making the
limitations of the appraiser more obvious than the true
worth of that which he appraises. For the judgment
of a contemporary is liable to be obscured by intellectual
incompatibilities and warped by personal
antagonisms; while the critic of a later generation,
though he may escape the influence of these sources of
error, is often ignorant, or forgetful, of the conditions
under which the labours of his predecessors have been
carried on. He is prone to lose sight of the fact that
without their clearing of the ground and rough-hewing
of the foundation-stones, the stately edifice
of later builders could not have been erected.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXVI" id="Num_CCLXXXVI">CCLXXXVI</a></p>

<p>The vulgar antithesis of fact and theory is founded
on a misconception of the nature of scientific theory,
which is, or ought to be, no more than the expression
of fact in a general form. Whatever goes beyond
such expression is hypothesis; and hypotheses are
not ends, but means. They should be regarded as
instruments by which new lines of inquiry are
indicated; or by the aid of which a provisional
coherency and intelligibility may be given to
seemingly disconnected groups of phenomena. The
most useful of servants to the man of science, they
are the worst of masters. And when the establishment
of the hypothesis becomes the end, and fact is
alluded to only so far as it suits the "Idee," science
has no longer anything to do with the business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXVII" id="Num_CCLXXXVII">CCLXXXVII</a></p>

<p>Scientific observation tell us that living birds form
a group or class of animals, through which a certain
form of skeleton runs; and that this kind of skeleton
differs in certain well-defined characters from that of
mammals. On the other hand, if anyone utterly
ignorant of osteology, but endowed with the artistic
sense of form, were set before a bird skeleton and a
mammalian skeleton, he would at once see that the
two were similar and yet different. Very likely he
would be unable to give clear expression to his just
sense of the differences and resemblances; perhaps
he would make great mistakes in detail if he tried.
Nevertheless, he would be able to draw from memory
a couple of sketches, in which all the salient points of
likeness and unlikeness would be reproduced with
sufficient accuracy. The mere osteologist, however
accurately he might put the resemblances and
differences into words, if he lacked the artistic
visualising faculty, might be hopelessly incompetent
to perform any such feat; lost in details, it might not
even occur to him that it was possible; or, still more
probably, the habit of looking for differences might
impair the perception of resemblances.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the artist might be
led to higher and broader views, and thus be more
useful to the progress of science than the osteological
expert. Not that the former attains the
higher truth by a different method; for the way of
reaching truth is one and indivisible. Whether he
knows it or not, the artist has made a generalization
from two sets of facts, which is perfectly scientific
in form; and trustworthy so far as it rests upon the
direct perception of similarities and dissimilarities.
The only peculiarity of the artistic application of
scientific method lies in the artist's power of visualizing
the result of his mental processes, of embodying
the facts of resemblance in a visible "type," and of
showing the manner in which the differences may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
be represented as modifications of that type; he
does, in fact, instinctively, what an architect, who
desires to demonstrate the community of plan in
certain ancient temples, does by the methodical
construction of plans, sections, and elevations, the
comparison of which will furnish him with the
"type" of such temples.</p>

<p>Thus, what I may term the artistic fashion of
dealing with anatomy is not only perfectly legitimate,
but has been of great utility. The harm of it does
not begin until the attempt is made to get more out
of this visual projection of thought than it contains;
until the origin of the notion of "type" is forgotten
and the speculative philosopher deludes himself with
the supposition that the generalization suggested by
fact is an "Idea" of the Pure Reason, with which
fact must, somehow or other, be made to agree.</p>

<p>Flowers are the primers of the morphologist; those
who run may read in them uniformity of type amidst
endless diversity, singleness of plan with complex
multiplicity of detail. As a musician might say,
every natural group of flowering plants is a sort
of visible fugue, wandering about a central theme
which is never forsaken, however it may, momentarily,
cease to be apparent.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCLXXXIX" id="Num_CCLXXXIX">CCLXXXIX</a></p>

<p>Like all the really great men of literature, Goethe
added some of the qualities of the man of science to
those of the artist, especially the habit of careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and patient observation of Nature. The great poet
was no mere book-learned speculator. His acquaintance
with mineralogy, geology, botany and osteology,
the fruit of long and wide studies, would have
sufficed to satisfy the requirements of a professoriate
in those days, if only he could have pleaded ignorance
of everything else. Unfortunately for Goethe's
credit with his scientific contemporaries, and, consequently,
for the attention attracted by his work,
he did not come forward as a man of science until
the public had ranged him among the men of literature.
And when the little men have thus classified
a big man, they consider that the last word has
been said about him; it appears to the thought
hardly decent on his part if he venture to stray
beyond the speciality they have assigned to him.
It does not seem to occur to them that a clear
intellect is an engine capable of supplying power
to all sorts of mental factories; nor to admit that,
as Goethe somewhere pathetically remarks, a man
may have a right to live for himself as well as
for the public; to follow the line of work that
happens to interest him, rather than that which
interests them.</p>

<p>On the face of the matter it is not obvious that
the brilliant poet had less chance of doing good
service in natural science than the dullest of dissectors
and nomenclators. Indeed, as I have endeavoured
to indicate, there was considerable reason, a hundred
years ago, for thinking that an infusion of the
artistic way of looking at things might tend to
revivify the somewhat mummified body of technical
zoology and botany. Great ideas were floating
about; the artistic apprehension was needed to give
these airy nothings a local habitation and a name; to
convert vague suppositions into definite hypotheses.
And I apprehend that it was just this service which
Goethe rendered by writing his essays on the intermaxillary
bone, on osteology generally, and on the
metamorphoses of plants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXC" id="Num_CCXC">CCXC</a></p>

<p>All this is mere justice to Goethe; but, as it is the
unpleasant duty of the historian to do justice upon,
as well as to, great men, it behoves me to add that
the germs of the worst faults of later speculative
morphologists are no less visible in his writings than
their great merits. In the artist-philosopher there
was, at best, a good deal more artist than philosopher;
and when Goethe ventured into the regions
which belong to pure science, this excess of a virtue
had all the consequences of a vice. "Trennen und
zahlen lag nicht in meiner Natur," says he; but the
mental operations of which "analysis and numeration"
are partial expressions are indispensable for
every step of progress beyond happy glimpses, even
in morphology; while, in physiology and in physics,
failure in the most exact performance of these
operations involves sheer disaster, as indeed Goethe
was afforded abundant opportunity of learning. Yet
he never understood the sharp lessons he received,
and put down to malice, or prejudice, the ill-reception
of his unfortunate attempts to deal with purely
physical problems.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXCI" id="Num_CCXCI">CCXCI</a></p>

<p>There was never any lack of the scientific
imagination about the great anatomist; and the
charge of indifference to general ideas, sometimes
brought against him, is stupidly unjust. But Cuvier
was one of those happily endowed persons in whom
genius never parts company with common-sense;
and whose perception of the importance of sound
method is so great that they look at even a truth,
hit upon by those who pursue an essentially vicious
method, with the sort of feeling with which an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

They hold it better to remain poor than obtain riches

<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCXCII" id="Num_CCXCII">CCXCII</a></p>

<p>The irony of history is nowhere more apparent
than in science. Here we see the men, over whose
minds the coming events of the world of biology
cast their shadows, doing their best to spoil their
case in stating it; while the man who represented
sound scientific method is doing his best to stay
the inevitable progress of thought and bolster up
antiquated traditions. The progress of knowledge
during the last seventy years enables us to see that
neither Geoffroy, nor Cuvier, was altogether right
nor altogether wrong; and that they were meant
to hunt in couples instead of pulling against one
another. Science has need of servants of very
different qualifications; of artistic constructors no
less than of men of business; of people to design
her palaces and of others to see that the materials
are sound and well-fitted together; of some to spur
investigators, and of others to keep their heads cool.
The only would-be servants, who are entirely
unprofitable, are those who do not take the trouble
to interrogate Nature, but imagine vain things about
her; and spin, from their inner consciousness, webs,
as exquisitely symmetrical as those of the most
geometrical of spiders, but alas! as easily torn to
pieces by some inconsidered bluebottle of a fact.</p>

<p>There are, however, other arguments commonly
brought forward in favour of the immortality of man,
which are to my mind not only delusive but mischievous.
The one is the notion that the moral government
of the world is imperfect without a system of
future rewards and punishments. The other is:
that such a system is indispensable to practical
morality. I believe that both these dogmas are very
mischievous lies.</p>

<p>With respect to the first, I am no optimist, but I
have the firmest belief that the Divine Government
(if we may use such a phrase to express the sum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the "customs of matter") is wholly just. The more

that the wicked does <i>not</i> flourish nor is the righteous
punished. But for this to be clear we must bear in
mind what almost all forget, that the rewards of life
are contingent upon obedience to the <i>whole</i> law&mdash;physical
as well as moral&mdash;and that moral obedience
will not atone for physical sin, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

believe that nothing would tend so effectually to

than a fair share of healthy work, directed towards
a definite object, combined with an equally fair share

<p>I ask myself&mdash;suppose you knew that by inflicting
prolonged pain on 100 rabbits you could discover a
way to the extirpation of leprosy, or consumption,
or locomotor ataxy, or of suicidal melancholia among
human beings, dare you refuse to inflict that pain?
Now I am quite unable to say that I dare. That
sort of daring would seem to me to be extreme moral
cowardice, to involve gross inconsistency.</p>

<p>For the advantage and protection of society, we
all agree to inflict pain upon man&mdash;pain of the most
prolonged and acute character&mdash;in our prisons, and
on our battlefields. If England were invaded, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
should have no hesitation about inflicting the maximum
of suffering upon our invaders for no other
object than our own good.</p>

<p>But if the good of society and of a nation is a
sufficient plea for inflicting pain on men, I think it
may suffice us for experimenting on rabbits or dogs.</p>

<p>At the same time, I think that a heavy moral
responsibility rests on those who perform experiments
of the second kind.</p>

<p>The wanton infliction of pain on man or beast is
a crime; pity is that so many of those who (as I
think rightly) hold this view, seem to forget that
the criminality lies in the wantonness and not in
the act of inflicting pain <i>per se</i>.</p>

need not have invented pain and sorrow at all&mdash;infinite
malevolence would very easily have deprived

that falls to our lot. After all, Butler's "Analogy"

<p>Whether motion disintegrates or integrates is, I
apprehend, a question of conditions. A whirlpool in
a stream may remain in the same spot for any
imaginable time. Yet it is the effect of the motion
of the particles of the water in that spot which
continually integrate themselves into the whirlpool
and disintegrate themselves from it. The whirlpool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
is permanent while the conditions last, though its
constituents incessantly change. Living bodies are
just such whirlpools. Matter sets into them in the
shape of food,&mdash;sets out of them in the shape of
waste products. Their individuality lies in the
constant maintenance of a characteristic form, not
in the preservation of material identity.</p>

<p>Most of us are idolators, and ascribe divine
powers to the abstractions "Force," "Gravity,"
"Vitality," which our own brains have created. I
do not know anything about "inert" things in
nature. If we reduce the world to matter and
motion, the matter is not "inert," inasmuch as the
same amount of motion affects different kinds of
matter in different ways. To go back to my own
illustration. The fabric of the watch is not inert,
every particle of it is in violent and rapid motion,
and the winding-up simply perturbs the whole
infinitely complicated system in a particular fashion.
Equilibrium means death, because life is a succession
of changes, while a changing equilibrium is a contradiction
in terms. I am not at all clear that a
living being is comparable to a machine running
down. On this side of the question the whirlpool
affords a better parallel than the watch. If you dam
the stream above or below, the whirlpool dies; just
as the living being does if you cut off its food, or
choke it with its own waste products. And if you
alter the sides or bottom of the stream you may kill
the whirlpool, just as you kill the animal by interfering
with its structure. Heat and oxidation as a
source of heat appear to supply energy to the living
machine, the molecular structure of the germ furnishing
the "sides and bottom of the stream," that is,
determining the results which the energy supplied
shall produce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

frugal, more industrious, and lived better lives than
their neighbours, while they stuck together like
Scotchmen.</p>

<p>Even the best of modern civilisations appears to
me to exhibit a condition of mankind which neither

opinion that, if there is no hope of a large improvement
of the condition of the greater part of the
human family; if it is true that the increase of
knowledge, the winning of a greater dominion over
Nature which is its consequence, and the wealth
which follows upon that dominion, are to make no
difference in the extent and the intensity of Want,
with its concomitant physical and moral degradation,
among the masses of the people, I should hail the
advent of some kindly comet, which would sweep
the whole affair away, as a desirable consummation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

<p>No induction, however broad its basis, can confer

<p>The doctrine of the conservation of energy tells
neither one way nor the other [on the doctrine of
immortality]. Energy is the cause of movement of
body, <i>i.e.</i> things having mass. States of consciousness
have no mass, even if they can be conceded to
be movable. Therefore even if they are caused by
molecular movements, they would not in any way
affect the store of energy.</p>

<p>Physical causation need not be the only kind of
causation, and when Cabanis said that thought was
a function of the brain, in the same way as bile
secretion is a <i>function</i> of the liver, he blundered
philosophically. Bile is a product of the transformation
of material energy. But in the mathematical
sense of the word "function," thought may be a
function of the brain. That is to say, it may arise
only when certain physical particles take on a certain
order.</p>

<p>By way of a coarse analogy, consider a parallel-sided
piece of glass through which light passes. It
forms no picture. Shape it so as to be a bi-convex,
and a picture appears in its focus.</p>

<p>Is not the formation of the picture a "function"
of the piece of glass thus shaped?</p>

<p>So, from your own point of view, suppose a mind-stuff&mdash;&#955;&#8000;&#947;&#959;&#962;&mdash;a
noumenal cosmic light such as is
shadowed in the fourth gospel. The brain of a dog
will convert it into one set of phenomenal pictures,
and the brain of a man into another. But in both
cases the result is the consequence of the way in
which the respective brains perform their "function."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>There is endless backwoodsman's work yet to be

weeder's and scavenger's occupation, I remain of the
opinion that his service should be counted acceptable,
and that no one has a right to ask more of him than
faithful performance of the duties he has undertaken.
I venture to count it an improbable suggestion that
any such person&mdash;a man, let us say, who has well-nigh
reached his threescore years and ten, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
graduated in all the faculties of human relationships;

deeper anxieties which cling about them; who has
felt the burden of young lives entrusted to his care,

negative criticism. It seems to me incredible that

<p>If the doctrine of a Providence is to be taken as
the expression, in a way "to be understanded of the
people," of the total exclusion of chance from a place
even in the most insignificant corner of Nature, if it
means the strong conviction that the cosmic process
is rational, and the faith that, throughout all duration,
unbroken order has reigned in the universe, I
not only accept it, but I am disposed to think it the
most important of all truths. As it is of more consequence
for a citizen to know the law than to be
personally acquainted with the features of those who
will surely carry it into effect, so this very positive
doctrine of Providence, in the sense defined, seems to
me far more important than all the theorems of
speculative theology. If, further, the doctrine is
held to imply that, in some indefinitely remote past
aeon, the cosmic process was set going by some
entity possessed of intelligence and foresight, similar
to our own in kind, however superior in degree,
if, consequently, it is held that every event, not
merely in our planetary speck, but in untold millions
of other worlds, was foreknown before these worlds
were, scientific thought, so far as I know anything
about it, has nothing to say about that hypothesis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
It is, in fact, an anthropomorphic rendering of the

<p>It may be well to remember that the highest
level of moral aspiration recorded in history was
reached by a few ancient Jews&mdash;Micah, Isaiah,

<p>Belief in majorities is not rooted in my breast, and

For myself I say deliberately, it is better to have a
millstone tied round the neck and be thrown into the
sea than to share the enterprises of those to whom
the world has turned, and will turn, because they
minister to its weaknesses and cover up the awful
realities which it shudders to look at.</p>

<p>Moral duty consists in the observance of those rules
of conduct which contribute to the welfare of society,
and by implication, of the individuals who compose it.</p>

<p>The end of society is peace and mutual protection,
so that the individual may reach the fullest and
highest life attainable by man. The rules of conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by which this end is to be attained are discoverable&mdash;like
the other so-called laws of Nature&mdash;by observation
and experiment, and only in that way.</p>

<p>Some thousands of years of such experience have
led to the generalisations, that stealing and murder,
for example, are inconsistent with the ends of society.
There is no more doubt that they are so than that
unsupported stones tend to fall. The man who
steals or murders, breaks his implied contract with
society, and forfeits all protection. He becomes an
outlaw, to be dealt with as any other feral creature.
Criminal law indicates the ways which have proved
most convenient for dealing with him.</p>

<p>All this would be true if men had no "moral sense"
at all, just as there are rules of perspective which
must be strictly observed by a draughtsman, and are
quite independent of his having any artistic sense.</p>


<p class="numeral"><a name="Num_CCCLXIX" id="Num_CCCLXIX">CCCLXIX</a></p>

<p>The moral sense is a very complex affair&mdash;dependent
in part upon associations of pleasure and
pain, approbation and disapprobation formed by
education in early youth, but in part also on an
innate sense of moral beauty and ugliness (how
originated need not be discussed), which is possessed
by some people in great strength, while some are
totally devoid of it&mdash;just as some children draw, or
are enchanted by music while mere infants, while
others do not know "Cherry Ripe" from "Rule
Britannia," nor can represent the form of the simplest
thing to the end of their lives.</p>

<p>Now for this last sort of people there is no reason
why they should discharge any moral duty, except
from fear of punishment in all its grades, from mere
disapprobation to hanging, and the duty of society is
to see that they live under wholesome fear of such
punishment short, sharp, and decisive.</p>

<p>For the people with a keen innate sense of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
beauty there is no need of any other motive. What
they want is knowledge of the things they may do
and must leave undone, if the welfare of society is to
be attained. Good people so often forget this that
some of them occasionally require hanging almost as
much as the bad.</p>

<p>If you ask why the moral inner sense is to be
(under due limitations) obeyed; why the few who
are steered by it move the mass in whom it is weak?
I can only reply by putting another question&mdash;Why
do the few in whom the sense of beauty is strong&mdash;Shakespeare,
Raffaele, Beethoven, carry the less
endowed multitude away? But they do, and always
will. People who overlook that fact attend neither
to history nor to what goes on about them.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin was a shrewd, excellent,
kindly man. I have great respect for him. The
force of genial common-sense respectability could no
further go. George Fox was the very antipodes of
all this, and yet one understands how he came to
move the world of his day, and Franklin did not.</p>

<p>As to whether we can fulfil the moral law, I
should say hardly any of us. Some of us are utterly
incapable of fulfilling its plainest dictates. As there
are men born physically cripples, and intellectually
idiots, so there are some who are moral cripples and
idiots, and can be kept straight not even by punishment.
For these people there is nothing but shutting
up, or extirpation.</p>

<p>The cardinal fact in the University questions
appears to me to be this: that the student to whose
wants the medi&aelig;val University was adjusted,
looked to the past and sought book-learning, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the modern looks to the future and seeks the knowledge
of things.</p>

<p>The medi&aelig;val view was that all knowledge worth
having was explicitly or implicitly contained in
various ancient writings; in the Scriptures, in the
writings of the greater Greeks, and those of the
Christian Fathers. Whatever apparent novelty
they put forward, was professedly obtained by
deduction from ancient data.</p>

<p>The modern knows that the only source of real
knowledge lies in the application of scientific methods
of enquiry to the ascertainment of the facts of existence;
that the ascertainable is infinitely greater than the
ascertained, and that the chief business of the
teacher is not so much to make scholars as to train
pioneers.</p>

<p>From this point of view, the University occupies a
position altogether independent of that of the copingstone
of schools for general education, combined
with technical schools of Theology, Law, and
Medicine. It is not primarily an institution for
testing the work of schoolmasters, or for ascertaining
the fitness of young men to be curates, lawyers,
or doctors.</p>

<p>It is an institution in which a man who claims to
devote himself to Science or Art, should be able to
find some one who can teach him what is already
known, and train him in the methods of knowing
more.</p>

<p>In my opinion a man's first duty is to find a way
of supporting himself, thereby relieving other people
of the necessity of supporting him. Moreover, the
learning to do work of practical value in the world,
in an exact and careful manner, is of itself a very
important education, the effects of which make themselves
felt in all other pursuits. The habit of doing
that which you do not care about when you would
much rather be doing something else, is invaluable.</p>

<p>Success in any scientific career requires an

<p>I have not the slightest doubt about the magnitude
of the evils which accrue from the steady
increase of European armaments; but I think
that this regrettable fact is merely the superficial
expression of social forces, the operation of which
cannot be sensibly affected by agreements between
Governments.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is a delusion to attribute the
growth of armaments to the "exactions of militarism."
The "exactions of industrialism," generated
by international commercial competition,
may, I believe, claim a much larger share in
prompting that growth. Add to this the French
thirst for revenge, the most just determination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
German and Italian peoples to assert their national
unity; the Russian Panslavonic fanaticism and
desire for free access to the western seas; the
Papacy steadily fishing in the troubled waters for
the means of recovering its lost (I hope for ever
lost) temporal possessions and spiritual supremacy;
the "sick man," kept alive only because each of his
doctors is afraid of the other becoming his heir.</p>

<p>When I think of the intensity of the perturbing
agencies which arise out of these and other conditions
of modern European society, I confess that the
attempt to counteract them by asking Governments
to agree to a maximum military expenditure, does
not appear to me to be worth making; indeed I think
it might do harm by leading people to suppose that
the desires of Governments are the chief agents in
determining whether peace or war shall obtain in
Europe.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of the priests in the long-run.

<p>Men are beings of a certain constitution, who,

<p>The Political Economists have gone the right
way to work&mdash;the way that the physical philosopher
follows in all complex affairs&mdash;by tracing out the
effects of one great cause of human action, the
desire of wealth, supposing it to be unchecked.</p>

<p>If they, or other people, have forgotten that there
are other potent causes of action which may interfere
with this, it is no fault of scientific method but only
their own stupidity.</p>

<p>Hydrostatics is not a "dismal science," because
water does not always seek the lowest level&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>

<p>There is much need that somebody should do for
what is vaguely called "Ethics" just what the
Political Economists have done. Settle the question
of what will be done under the unchecked action of
certain motives, and leave the problem of "ought"
for subsequent consideration.</p>

<p>For, whatever they ought to do, it is quite certain
the majority of men will act as if the attainment of
certain positive and negative pleasures were the end
of action.</p>

<p>We want a science of "Eubiotics" to tell us

<p>Those who wish to attain to some clear and
definite solution of the great problems which Mr.
Darwin was the first person to set before us in later
times must base themselves upon the facts which are
stated in his great work, and, still more, must
pursue their inquiries by the methods of which he
was so brilliant an exemplar throughout the whole
of his life. You must have his sagacity, his untiring
search after the knowledge of fact, his readiness
always to give up a preconceived opinion to that
which was demonstrably true, before you can hope
to carry his doctrines to their ultimate issue; and
whether the particular form in which he has put
them before us may be such as is finally destined to
survive or not is more, I venture to think, than anybody
is capable at this present moment of saying.
But this one thing is perfectly certain&mdash;that it is only
by pursuing his methods, by that wonderful single-mindedness,

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
